<p style="padding-left: 4%;"><b>Defining Candidates for Exception Views</b><br>
The following fields are used to define in which exception views an object can be<br>
displayed:
     <ul style="padding-left: 4%;">
        <li>The ExceptionViewName field of the Exception_View_Class object </li>
        <li>The ExceptionViewList field of the object</li>
     </ul>
<p style="padding-left: 4%;">The ExceptionViewName field contains the unique name of the<br>
    Exception_View_Class object that you created. You must create one<br>
    Exception_View_Class object for each exception view that you define, and the<br>
    name of each object must be unique.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 4%;">The ExceptionViewList field of a resource object contains a list of<br>
    ExceptionViewNames. You must specify the ExceptionViewName of each exception<br>
    view in which you want this resource to be displayed when the resource has an<br>
    exception state. Because a resource can be displayed in more than one exception<br>
    view, the ExceptionViewList field can contain a list of names.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 4%;">If you create a resource object to be displayed in an open exception view, one of<br>
    the following tasks is required:</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 4%;">
    <li>Change the ExceptionViewList field from a null value to the list of candidate<br>
        views</li>
    <li>Close and then reopen the exception view.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 4%;">If you want to delete a resource object from RODM that is in an open exception<br>
    view, remove the ExceptionViewName from the ExceptionViewList before you<br>
    delete the resource object. If you delete the resource object from RODM before you<br>
    remove it from the ExceptionViewList, the resource object remains in the view until<br>
    it is closed because GMFHS cannot send updates for deleted objects.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 4%;">For SNA resources managed by SNA topology manager, the ExceptionViewList<br>
    field is set by the NetView program when the object is created. The NetView<br>
    program determines the value of this field based on the class of the object. You can<br>
    change the default mapping of classes to exception views by customizing the<br>
    FLBEXV table. For more information about customizing the FLBEXV table, see the<br>
    <i>IBM Tivoli NetView for z/OS SNA Topology Manager Implementation Guide.</i></p>
<p style="padding-left: 4%;"><b>Defining the ExceptionViewFilter Field</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 4%;">The ExceptionViewFilter field is used to define the state that an object must be in<br>
    to be placed in an exception view. There are 5 values in the field; each represents a<br>
    different status filter. Filter 1 is for DisplayStatus, and the remaining 4 filters are<br>
    for UserStatus.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 4%;">The default for the ExceptionViewFilter is X'4000' (bit value '0100 0000 0000 0000'),<br>
    which indicates that:<br>
    <ul style="padding-left: 4%;">
        <li>Only objects in an exception state are candidates for the view. Objects in an<br>
            exception state are those objects that have the value XCPT in the ResourceTraits<br>
            field.</li>
        <li>No filtering is done on UserStatus.</li>
    </ul></p>
<p style="padding-left: 4%;">This means that if an object maps to an exception state, it is displayed in an<br>
    exception view regardless of its UserStatus. The default value of the<br>
    ExceptionViewFilter can be changed at either the class or object level.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 4%;"><b>DisplayStatus Filter:</b> Set the ExceptionViewFilter for DisplayStatus to 0 (zero) if<br>
    you want all objects to be considered candidates for an exception view regardless</p><hr><hr>


<p style="padding-left: 4%;">of the DisplayStatus. If you want only objects that are in an exception state to be<br>
    considered candidates for an exception view, leave the ExceptionViewFilter for<br>
    DisplayStatus set to 1, which is the default value.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 4%;">Shadow objects do not have a DisplayStatus field, so they are not considered to be<br>
    monitorable objects. However, if you set the filter for DisplayStatus in the<br>
    ExceptionViewFilter field to 0 (zero), shadow objects are candidates for the view.<br> Shadow objects must adhere to all of the criteria specified in the<br>
    ExceptionViewFilter field of the view object and the ExceptionViewList field of the<br>
    shadow object must contain the ExceptionViewName of the view.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 4%;"><b>UserStatus Filters:</b> Set the UserStatus filters in the ExceptionViewFilter to indicate<br>
    which UserStatuses are filtered out of the exception view. For example, if you want<br>
    to filter out objects that have a UserStatus of “mark” set the mark UserStatus filter<br>
    in the ExceptionViewFilter field to bit value X'01'. If you want to filter all objects<br>
    that are not marked, set the mark UserStatus filter in the ExceptionViewFilter field<br>
    to bit value X'10'.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 4%;">An object is not displayed in an exception view if the following bits for UserStatus<br>
    are on:<br>
    <ul style="padding-left: 4%;">
        <li>X'02' (not monitored)</li>
        <li>X'40' (aggregation is suspended)</li>
    </ul> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 4%;">This means that you cannot filter on these bits, because they are automatically<br>
    filtered from an exception view.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 4%;">Use the “List Suspended Resources” at the NetView management console to<br>
    determine which objects have been suspended from aggregation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 4%;">Table 13 contains examples of alternate values for the ExceptionViewFilter field and<br>
    the resultant exception view:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 4%;"><i>Table 13. Examples of ExceptionViewFilter Field Values and Resultant Views</i></p>

        filtered out of the view.</td></tr>

<p style="padding-left: 4%; font-size: 16px;"><b>Customizing the DisplayStatus Mapping Table for Exception<br>
    Views</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 4%;">You can customize the mapping of DisplayStatus values using the table DUIFSMT.<br> This table consists of statements created by the DUIFSMTE macro.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 4%;">To customize the table, change the DUIFSMTE statements in sample DUIFSMT to<br>
    reflect the desired DisplayStatus mapping and then use sample CNMSJH13 to:<br>
    <ul style="padding-left: 4%;">
        <li>Assemble and link-edit the table to create a load module.</li>
        <li>Refresh the DisplayStatus change method.</li>
        <li>Trigger a recalculation of the DisplayStatus mapping for all real and aggregate<br>
            objects in RODM.</li>
    </ul></p><hr><hr>


<p style="padding-left: 4%;">Recalculate the DisplayStatus mapping so that the new status is immediately<br>
    available for exception views. If you do not want to recalculate until the<br>
    DisplayStatus of the object is changed, comment out the following statement in<br>

    information.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 3%;"><b>END</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 5%;">This keyword ends table processing. DUIFSMTE END must be the last<br>
    statement in your source for the table.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 3%;"><b>Usage Notes:</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 5%;">1. In sample DUIFSMT, DUIFSMTE must start in column 10. You can code the<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keywords in the columns following DUIFSMTE, separated by a space.<br>
    2. If a statement exceeds 71 characters, put a continuation character in column 72<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and continue the statement in column 16 of the next line.<br>
    3. If you enter more than one statement with the same class_name and<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resource_name values, the first statement is used and the other statements are<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ignored; a warning message is issued.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 3%;"><b>Default Values for Classes</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 3%;">To specify the default values for all classes not defined in the DUIFSMT table, use<br>
    the value ALL for class_name. For example:<br>
    DUIFSMTE CLASS=ALL,XCPT=(DEGRD,INTER,SDGRD,UNSAT)</p><hr><hr>


<p style="padding-left: 3%;">These values apply to all classes unless they are overridden by other statements.<br>
    You only need to code the specific classes that differ from the values you specify<br>
    for CLASS=ALL.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 3%;"><b>Specifying Resource Names for DisplayStatus Mapping</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 3%;">You can specify the DisplayStatus mapping for specific resources or groups of<br>
    resources within a class. To specify the resource name, use the RESOURCE or<br>
    MYNAME keyword of the DUIFSMTE macro. You can use an asterisk (*), the<br>
    wildcard character, at the end of the resource name to specify groups of resources.<br>
    You cannot embed wildcard characters in the resource name.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 3%;">If you want to customize a specific resource, code the statement for that resource<br>
    before other generic statements that match in its class. (See Usage Note 3 on page<br>
    106.) For example, assume that you have a resource in the<br>
    GMFHS_Managed_Real_Objects_Class whose DisplayResourceName is RALXT1<br>
    and MyName is SYSPLEX.PLEX1.RALXT1. If you want resource<br>
    SYSPLEX.PLEX1.RALXT1 to map to XCPT if it has an unsatisfactory status, but<br>
    you do not want other resources in that class to do the same, code the statement<br>
    for the resource first as shown in Figure 27:.</p>
<img style="padding-left: 2%;" src="C:\Users\my pc\OneDrive\Desktop\html1/(101-200)pc3.jpg">
<p style="padding-left: 3%;"><i>Figure 27. Customizing a Resource</i></p>
<p style="padding-left: 3%;">If, in Figure 27, the second DUIFSMTE statement had been coded before the first<br>
    DUIFSMTE statement, resource SYSPLEX.PLEX1.RALXT1 and all other objects in<br>
    the GMFHS_Managed_Real_Objects_Class map to an exception only when they<br>
    have an intermediate status.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 3%;">The rules for the RESOURCE keyword are the same as the rules for the<br>
    RESOURCE keyword in the customization tables of the SNA topology manager.<br> See the <i>IBM Tivoli NetView for z/OS SNA Topology Manager Implementation Guide</i> for<br>
    more information.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 3%;">Figure 28 illustrates an example of coding both a MYNAME keyword and a<br>
    RESOURCE keyword for the same class. Assume that you have a resource object in<br>
    the GMFHS_Managed_Real_Objects_Class whose MyName is<br>
    SYSPLEX.PLEX1.RALXT1 and DisplayResourceName is RALXT1. If you coded<br>
    DUIFSMTE entries as shown in Figure 28, the resource matches against all three<br>
    DUIFSMTE entries. However, because the order in which the statements are coded<br>
    is important, the first DUIFSMTE entry is the one that matches the exception state.<br>
    This object is an exception only if its DisplayStatus is intermediate.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 2%;"><b>Examples of Customizing DisplayStatus Mapping</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 2%;">The examples in this topic are provided to give you a better understanding of<br>
    mapping DisplayStatus to an exception state. In the first example (shown in<br>
    Figure 29), assume the following conditions:<br>
<ul>
    <li>You want to display all objects of the t4Node (1.3.18.0.0.1844) class with a<br>
        DisplayStatus of unsatisfactory or unknown in an exception view. (Use the alias<br>
        from Table 14 on page 104 for the class name.)</li>

<p style="padding-left: 3%;"><i>Figure 30. DisplayStatus Mapping Table Coding Example 2</i></p><br>
<p style="padding-left: 3%;"><b>Creating a DisplayStatus Method for Exception Views</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 3%;">You can code an object independent method to provide an extra level of<br>
    DisplayStatus exception processing in addition to what is provided by the<br>
    DUIFSMT table. A sample user method, DUIFCUXM, is provided for this purpose.<br>
    See this sample when writing your user method.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 3%;">If you specify a method name with the USRXMETH keyword in the DUIFSMT<br>
    table, that method is triggered asynchronously each time the DisplayStatus of the<br>
    specified object changes. This method must follow the guidelines for RODM<br>
    methods. For more information about writing RODM methods, see Chapter 13,<br>
    “Writing RODM Methods,” on page 343.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 3%;">The method is triggered asynchronously from the DUIFCRDC method and is<br>
    passed the object ID for which a DisplayStatus change has occurred. This method<br>
    has the following input parameters:</p>
<img style="padding-left: 3%;" src="C:\Users\my pc\OneDrive\Desktop\html1/(101-200)pc6.jpg">
<p style="padding-left: 3%;">Because the user method is asynchronous, the original conditions that cause it to<br>
    be driven might not be true when the user method gains control. Therefore, no<br>
    prequeried field values are passed to the user method from method DUIFCRDC.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 3%;">Be aware that timing and error handling problems can occur. For example, the<br>
    mapping of exception state from DUIFSMT can cause an object to be added to an<br>
    exception view, but the user method can change the exception state of the same<br>
    object so that it is removed a second later. Errors in the user method must be<br>
    resolved by the user method. For more information about asynchronous error<br>
    handling in RODM, see Chapter 11, “Writing Applications that Use RODM,” on<br>
    page 305.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 3%;">If you are receiving unexpected results from your user method and suspect that it<br>
    is not being triggered, the user method might be installed incorrectly. In this case,<br>
    RODM issues a return code and reason code in the transaction information block.<br>
    This error is written to the RODM log as a UAPI trace entry, depending on the<br>
    values of LOG_LEVEL and MLOG_LEVEL that are set in the customization file.<br>
    The log entry contains the following information:<br>
  <ul >
    <li >Return code: 8</li>
    <li >Reason code: 81</li>
    <li >Function ID: 1416 (Trigger an Object Independent Method)</li>
    <li >Data: <i>your user method name</i></li>
  </ul><hr><hr>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 3%;"><b>Note:</b> To test the installation of your user method, you can trigger it using<br>
    RODMVIEW.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 3%;">The user method accepts any criteria, including information in RODM, to<br>
    determine the exception state of an object. When the exception state is determined,<br>
    method DUIFVCFT, which is provided by IBM, is triggered from the user method<br>
    to implement the status in the ResourceTraits field of the specified object.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 3%;">Case 1: Change exception state of an object to XCPT.<br> 1. From the user method, pass Requested_exception_status=1 to method<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DUIFVCFT.<br> 2. DUIFVCFT changes the ResourceTraits field to XCPT.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 3%;">Case 2: Change exception state of an object to NOXCPT.<br> 1. From the user method, pass Requested_exception_status=0 to method<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DUIFVCFT.<br> 2. DUIFVCFT changes the ResourceTraits field to NOXCPT.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 3%;">In either case, the setting of the ResourceTraits field can result in an object being<br>
    added to, or deleted from, an open exception view. This determination is made by<br>
    method DUIFVCFT.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 3%;">The input parameters to method DUIFVCFT are the same as the input to the user<br>
    method, except Requested_exception_status is filled in only when you trigger<br>
    DUIFVCFT. Trigger DUIFVCFT only if the user method determines that the<br>
    exception state of the input object needs to change.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 3%;">You can also write a user method to filter resources from a view that are marked<br>
    as failing because of a higher-level resource failure. Method DUIFCUX2 is<br>
    provided as a sample method that performs this function.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 3%;"><b>Implementing Exception View Processing for MultiSystem<br>
    Manager</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 3%;">An exception view is a graphic list of objects that can be filtered by the value of<br>
    the DisplayStatus or UserStatus fields of the object. Enabling exception view<br>
    processing for MultiSystem Manager objects enables you to recognize failing<br>
    resources in a timely manner.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 3%;">To implement exception view processing:<br>
    1. Modify NetView part DUIFSMT to include the statements from sample<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FLCSSMT. DUIFSMT is an assembler part and does not support the<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;%INCLUDE statement. As a result, you must include these statements into<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DUIFSMT by manually editing the file.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample FLCSSMT is the sample table that maps the DisplayStatus of<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MultiSystem Manager objects and classes to exceptions or non-exceptions.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FLCSSMT is shipped in the CNMSAMP data set.<br><br>
    2. Run the NetView JCL sample CNMSJH13 to assemble and link-edit DUIFSMT.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This results in:<br>
   <ul class="b">
    <li>Assembling and link-editing the table to create a load module.</li>
    <li>Refreshing the DisplayStatus change method.</li>
    <li>Recalculating the DisplayStatus mapping for all real and aggregate objects in<br>
        RODM.</li>
    </ul>
<p style="padding-left: 3%;">3. Modify the MultiSystem Manager exception view file.<hr><hr>
    <p style="padding-left: 5%;">The MultiSystem Manager exception view table lists the names of the exception<br>
views that a RODM object is associated with when the RODM object is created<br>
by MultiSystem Manager.<br> If you have already implemented exception view processing for MultiSystem<br>Manager, modify the existing MultiSystem Manager exception view table.<br>
If you have not already implemented exception view processing for<br>
MultiSystem Manager, copy the FLCSEXV sample to a data set accessible from<br>the DSIPARM DD concatenation defined in your NetView start procedure.<br>
Rename the sample file to a name appropriate for your environment. The<br>
FLCSEXV sample resides in the CNMSAMP data set.<br>
The FLCSEXV sample contains sample exception view statements for all of the<br>
MultiSystem Manager real object classes. You can add exception views for<br>
aggregate objects. You can also create an object in the Exception_View_Class<br>
class (see sample FLCSDM6 for an example) and then use the MyName field of<br>
the Exception_View_Class object as the value for the EXVWNAME keyword.<br>
All of the statements are commented in the sample. If you want to perform<br>
exception view processing for a particular object class, uncomment the<br>
statements associated with that object class.<br>
FLCSEXV does support the %INCLUDE statement. See the prologue of sample<br>
FLCSEXV for information regarding the syntax of the table.</p></p></p>
<p style="padding-left: 5%;">4. Specify the name of the MultiSystem Manager exception view table on the<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(MSM)COMMON.FLC_EXCEPTION_VIEW_FILE statement in the CNMSTUSR<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or CxxSTGEN member.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 5%;">5. The MultiSystem Manager data model is loaded using the NetView CNMSJH12<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sample. The prologue of each of these samples contains a short description of<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the data model members that are shipped with MultiSystem Manager.<br></p>
<p style="padding-left: 5%;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are using the Open feature, uncomment the statement in the CNMSJH12<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JCL sample for the FLCSDM6O data model sample.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 3%; font-size: 16px; "><b>Locate Resource Function</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 5%; ">The locate resource function enables the operator to display a resource when the<br>
    name of the view that contains it is unknown. Multiple types of views can be<br>
    searched and built when the object is found in RODM.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 5%; ">When the locate resource function is selected, the request is passed to GMFHS.<br>
    GMFHS issues a locate request for the LocateName field and the<br>
    DisplayResourceName field for the uppercase version of the entry. The requested<br>
    views are built for objects in either list. Note that the LocateName field is of type<br>
    IndexList and can have multiple values. Therefore, you can have multiple aliases<br>
    for the object, and locate the object using any of them. Remember that the locate is<br>
    on an uppercase string, so the values in LocateName must also be uppercase. The<br>
    value of DisplayResourceName field does not have to be uppercase.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 3%; font-size: 16px; "><b>Restricting Recursive Views</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 5%; ">While building some types of views, GMFHS queries a large number of objects to<br>
    find all of the objects that belong in a view. This can result in views that are</p><hr><hr>
<p style="padding-left: 5%; ">unusable because they have too many objects in them. You can use the HopCount<br>
    field to restrict the number of objects that GMFHS queries. For example, if you set<br>
    the value of the HopCount field to 3, GMFHS only queries up to 3 levels of objects<br>
    from the selected object. If you want GMFHS to query all objects, set the value of<br>
    the HopCount field to 0 (zero).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 3%; font-size: 16px; "><b>Refreshing Open Views</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 5%; ">GMFHS sends a view change notification to the workstation when an object, or<br>
    connectivity field, used in building the view has changed in RODM. This is done<br>
    by a notification method, DUIFVNOT, that is installed on all connectivity fields as<br>
    well as fields on objects or classes that control how views are built. The method is<br>
    installed by sample FLBTRDME when the data model is loaded. FLBTRDME calls<br>
    an object independent method, DUIFVINS, which installs DUIFVNOT on each<br>
    field.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 5%; ">Note that the notification method is inherited by the objects of a class. For a list of<br>
    all the fields on which GMFHS installs DUIFVNOT, see sample FLBTRDME.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 5%; ">Method DUIFVINS must be run for each new class or connectivity field that is<br>
    added to the data model. See “DUIFVINS: Install View Granularity Method<br>
    (DUIFVNOT)” on page 507 for a description of method DUIFVINS.</p>

<p style=" font-size: 16px; "><b>Applying Span-of-Control to Views</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 5%; ">This section shows how GMFHS determines which resource and view names are<br>
    used to check span authorization when building span-restricted views.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 5%; ">This section often refers to the NGMFVSPN and CTL attributes. These are not<br>
    RODM attributes. They are attributes defined in either the NetView operator<br>
    profiles in the DSIPRF data set or the NETVIEW segment of the USER profiles in a<br>
    system authorization facility (SAF) product, such as RACF®
    . See the <i>IBM Tivoli<br>
    NetView for z/OS Security Reference</i> for more information about these attributes.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 5%; ">Spans can be used to restrict operators from seeing views and resources within<br>
    views. To apply span-of-control to views:<br>
   <ul class="b">
    <li>Use the NGMFVSPN attribute to specify whether each operator is subject to<br>
        span checking for views and resources within views.</li>
    <li>Use the NetView span table to define views and resources within views to<br>
        spans.</li>
    <li>Use the CTL attribute to specify that span checking must be done for this<br>
        operator.</li>
   </ul></p>
<p style="padding-left: 5%; ">For more information about defining resources and views to spans in the NetView<br>
    span table, see the <i>IBM Tivoli NetView for z/OS Security Reference.</i></p>
<p style="padding-left: 5%; ">Before you can use spans to restrict views and resources within views, you need to<br>
    understand the naming convention used by RODM to identify views and<br>
    resources. Resource and view names are represented in the NetView span table as<br>
    resource and view identifiers. These identifiers, which can contain wildcard<br>
    characters, must match exactly the names used by GMFHS during the view<br>
    building process. The GMFHS rules for determining resource and view names are<br>
    described in this section.</p><hr><hr>


<p style="padding-left: 3%; font-size: 16px; "><b>Views</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">As described in “Object Discovery Process” on page 87, all of the views built by<br>
    GMFHS can be classified as either predefined or dynamically built. GMFHS uses a<br>
    different procedure to determine the view name, depending on whether the viewis predefined or dynamic.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; font-size: 16px;"><b>Defining Predefined Views to Spans</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Predefined views are defined by the customer. Each predefined view is represented<br>
    by a view object in RODM. The following types of views can be predefined to<br>
    RODM:</p>
   <ul class="c">
    <li>Network</li>
    <li>Exception</li>
    <li>Configuration peer</li>
    <li>Configuration backbone</li>
    <li>Configuration logical</li>
    <li>Configuration physical</li>
    <li>More Detail logical</li>
    <li>More Detail physical</li>
   </ul>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Network, exception, and configuration peer views can only be predefined; they are<br>
    never dynamically built by RODM. The other views in the above list can be either<br>
    predefined or dynamically built.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">When you define a predefined view to a span in the NetView span table, the viewi<br>dentifier must be equal to the MyName attribute of the view object. To see how<br>
    predefined views can be defined to spans, consider this example. Suppose a<br>
    network view is predefined to RODM and the MyName field is equal to<br>
    MY_NETWORK_VIEW. If the span_level position of the NGMFVSPN attribute specifies<br>
    that view names are checked for span authorization, GMFHS verifies that the<br>
    operator requesting the view has span authorization for view name<br>
    MY_NETWORK_VIEW.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">If the following statement is defined in the NetView span table, an operator, with<br>
    span SPAN1 started, can access the view:<br></p>
    <p style="font-size: 11px; padding-left: 6%;" >SPAN=SPAN1,VIEW=MY_NETWORK_VIEW;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Alternatively, a SPANDEF statement can be defined using wildcard characters that<br>
    matches the MY_NETWORK_VIEW view name, such as in the following examples:</p>
<ul class="c" style="font-size: 12px;">
    <li>SPANDEF SPAN=SPAN1,VIEW=*VIEW;</li>
    <li>SPANDEF SPAN=SPAN1,VIEW=M*;</li>
    <li>SPANDEF SPAN=SPAN1,VIEW=*NETWORK*;</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; font-size: 16px;"><b>Defining Dynamically Built Views to Spans</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Dynamically built views are not represented by a view object in RODM. When you<br>
    define a dynamically built view to a span in the NetView span table, the view<br>
    identifier must be equal to the DisplayResourceName field of the selected resource,<br>
    appended with a three or four character suffix designating the type of view.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 6%;">This example shows how a dynamically built view can be defined to a span.<br>
    Suppose an NMC locate failing resource view is selected for an aggregate resource<br>
    whose DisplayResourceName field is equal to MyAggResource. If the span_level<br>
    position of the NGMFVSPN attribute specifies span checking for view names,<br>
    GMFHS verifies that the operator requesting the view has span authorization for<br>
    view name MyAggResource-FP.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">As another example, suppose a configuration parent view is selected for a real<br>
    resource whose DisplayResourceName field is equal to NETA.NCP1. If the span_level<br>
    position of the NGMFVSPN attribute specifies span checking for view names,<br>
    GMFHS verifies that the operator requesting the view has span authorization for<bR>
    view name NETA.NCP1-PAR.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">When you are defining views to spans, especially dynamically built views, it can<br>
    be advantageous to use wildcard characters. For more information about wildcard<br>
    characters, see the <i>IBM Tivoli NetView for z/OS Security Reference.</i></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b>Examples of Defining Views to Spans</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">The following examples are provided to help you understand how to define views<br>
    to spans. The examples assume:<br></p>
<ul class="c">
    <li>CTL=SPECIFIC has been defined for the operator requesting the view.</li>
    <li>The <i>span_level</i> position of NGMFVSPN specifies span checking for view names</li>
    <li>The operator requesting the view has span SPAN1 started</li>
    <li>There are no other SPANDEF statements defined in the span table that matches<br>
        the view names other than those that are defined in the examples.</li>
</ul><hr><hr>


<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b>Example 1:</b> SPANDEF statements that define view identifiers to spans do not exist<br>
    in the NetView span table. The operator cannot open any views until one or more<br>
    view identifiers have been defined to span SPAN1 with SPANDEF statements in<br>
    the NetView span table.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b>Example 2:</b> Because dynamically built views derive their view names from the<br>
    resource by which they were selected, resource identifiers can be defined to spans<br>
    based on the name of the resource. For example, assume all resource names in<br>
    network A begin with the characters NETA and the following statement is defined in<br>
    the NetView span table:</p>
<ul class="c">
    <li style="font-size: 10px;">SPANDEF SPAN=SPAN1,VIEW=NETA*;</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">An operator with span SPAN1 started can display any view whose view name<br>
    begins with NETA, such as NETA.NCP-FP, NETA_NETWORK_VIEW, NETA.HOST-MDL or NETA.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b>Example 3:</b> If restricting operators by resource name is not feasible, perhaps<br>
    access to views are restricted by view type. For example, to authorize an operator<br>
    to see only NMC locate failing resource or more detail views, define the following<br>
    statement in the NetView span table:</p>
<ul class="c">
    <li style="font-size: 10px;">SPANDEF SPAN=SPAN1,VIEW=(*-FP,*-MD*);</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">An operator with span SPAN1 started can display any NMC locate failing resource<br>
    or more detail view.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b>Example 4:</b> To give an operator span authorization for all NMC locate failing<br>
    resource views except those that are generated by resources in network A, define<br>
    the following statement in the NetView span table:</p>
<ul class="c">
    <li style="font-size: 10px;">SPANDEF SPAN=SPAN1,VIEW=(*-FP<NETA*-FP>);</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">An operator with span SPAN1 started can display any NMC locate failing resource<br>
    view except those that are generated by a resource whose DisplayResourceName<br>
    begins with the characters NETA.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b>Example 5:</b> To give an operator span authorization for all views except more<br>
    detail views, define the following statement in the NetView span table:</p>
<ul class="c">
    <li style="font-size: 10px;">SPANDEF SPAN=SPAN1,VIEW=*<*-M*>;</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">An operator with span SPAN1 started can display any view except for any type of<br>
    more detail view</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Example 6: View names are truncated at a maximum of 32 characters. If you have<bR>
    a resource whose DisplayResourceName field is greater than 32 characters, for<br>
    example, a DisplayResourceName value of NETWORKA.OPCENTER22.OPERATOR.SHIFT1.<br> If this resource is selected and a configuration parent view is requested, the<br>
    resulting dynamic view name sh be NETWORKA.OPCENTER22.OPERATOR.SHIFT1-PAR.<br> However, the view name is truncated to 32 characters which results in<br>
    NETWORKA.OPCENTER22.OPERATOR-PAR. Even though the DisplayResourceName is 32<br>
    characters, it is truncated because the suffix must be contained within the 32<br>
    character view name. The suffix is never truncated from the view name.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Depending on your SPANDEF definitions, this truncation might cause you<br>
    problems in your span table. Assume that you have set the DisplayResourceName<br>
    of a group of resources to indicate which shift of operators are responsible for</p><hr><Hr>


<p style="padding-left: 6%;">monitoring them. To give an operator span authorization for all resources<br>
    designated as SHIFT1 resources, you defined the following statement in the<br>
    NetView span table:</p>
<ul class="c">
    <li style="font-size: 10px;">SPANDEF SPAN=SPAN1,VIEW=*SHIFT1*;</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">View name NETWORKA.OPCENTER22.OPERATOR-PAR does not match this SPANDEF<br>
    statement and the operator cannot display the view. You must either set the value<br>
    of DisplayResourceName so the length of the value is less than 28 characters or<br>
    define SPANDEF statements that do not reference truncated characters of the<br>
    DisplayResourceName.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; padding-left: 2%;"><b>Resources</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">If the span_level position of the NGMFVSPN attribute specifies span checking for<br>
    resource names, only those resources that are authorized to a span started for the<br>
    operator requesting the view are displayed in the view. Before you define resource<br>
    identifiers to spans in the NetView span table, understand which resource names<br>
    are used by GMFHS to determine span authorization.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">A resource is monitorable if it can be displayed in a view and is not a shadow<br>
    object. For example, all resources defined in the GMFHS data model under class<bR>
    GMFHS_Monitorable_Objects_Parent_Class are monitorable objects. All<br>
    monitorable objects in RODM have the following fields:</p>
<ul class="c">
    <li>MyName</li>
    <li>v DisplayResourceName</li>
    <li>UserSpanName</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">You can assign a value to the MyName field when you create an object in RODM,<br>
    but you cannot modify the MyName value after the object is created.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">You can assign and modify the DisplayResourceName field. This field is used to<bR>
    create the resource names displayed in NetView management console views.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">The DisplayResourceName can be set by GMFHS method DUIFCLRT. This method<br>
    is used to link the DisplayResourceType field of a resource object to the Resources<br>
    field of an object of the Display_Resource_Type_Class. If the DisplayResourceName<bR>
    is null when the method is triggered, the method sets the value of the<br>
    DisplayResourceName field equal to the value of the MyName field. If the<br>
    DisplayResourceName is not null when the method is triggered, no change is<br>
    made to the DisplayResourceName.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b>Note:</b> Remember that MultiSystem Manager, SNA topology manager, and other<br>
    user applications can modify the DisplayResourceName.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">You can also create and modify the UserSpanName field. MultiSystem Manager, as<br>
    well as other user applications, can modify the UserSpanName field. For more<br>
    information about how MultiSystem Manager uses this field, see <i>IBM Tivoli<br>
    NetView for z/OS Installation: Configuring Graphical Components.</i></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">SNA objects defined in RODM as shadow objects, that is, objects defined in the<br>
    GMFHS_Shadow_Objects_Class, do not have a UserSpanName field. To ensure<br>
    consistency across RODM-based and workstation-based views, only the MyName<Br>
    field is used to determine span authorization for shadow objects. Even though the<br>
    DisplayResourceName field can be defined for a shadow object and this name is<br>
    displayed in a view, the name is not used to determine span authorization.</p><hr><hr>


<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Depending on how you use RODM, you can assign a different value to each of<br>
    these fields for a given resource object. For example, when defining a given<br>
    workstation in your network, you can define the MyName field as<br>
    <i>netid.resource_type.real_resource_name</i> and use this field to keep track of the<br>
    resources in your network.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">You can then define DisplayResourceName for that workstation as the userid of the<br>
    user who owns the workstation. Because the DisplayResourceName value is<br>
    displayed as the resource identifier in views, this can make it easier for operators<br>
    to determine the office in which a failing resource is located.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Similarly, you can define the UserSpanName as the netid for the network that<br>
    contains the workstation. You can then use the UserSpanName to define a group of<br>
    workstations that are all in the same <i>netid.</i></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">GMFHS uses the following logic to determine span authorization for a resource in<br>
    a view:</p>
<ul class="c">
    <li>If the resource is a shadow object, the MyName field is always used to<br>
        determine span authorization.</li>
        
    <li>If the resource is not a shadow object:</li>
     <p>– If a value exists for UserSpanName, the UserSpanName field is used to<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;determine span authorization.</p>
    <p>– If a value does not exist for UserSpanName, but a value does exist for<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;DisplayResourceName, the DisplayResourceName field is used to determine<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;span authorization.</p>
    <p>– If a value does not exist for UserSpanName or DisplayResourceName, the<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;MyName field is used to determine span authorization.</p>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b>Examples of Restricting Resources Within Views Using Spans</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">The following examples show how you can restrict resources within views. The<br>
    examples are based on the following assumptions:</p>
<ul class="c">
    <li>CTL=SPECIFIC was defined for the operator requesting the view.</li>
    <li>The span_level position of NGMFVSPN specifies span checking for resource<br>
        names.</li>
    <li>The operator requesting the view started span SPAN1.</li>
    <li>There are no other SPANDEF statements defined in the span table that match<br>
        the resource name.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b>Note:</b> If a CHARVAR field has a zero (0) length, it is considered to be null.<br>
    MyName, DisplayResourceName, and UserSpanName are all CHARVAR fields.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Example 1: If DisplayResourceName and UserSpanName are both null, the<br>
    MyName field determines span authorization for the resource. For example, a<br>
    monitorable resource in RODM has a MyName value of SYSPLEX.PLEX1.RALXT1.<br> The DisplayResourceName and UserSpanName are null. The following statement<br>
    is defined in the NetView span table:</p>
    <ul class="c">
        <li style="font-size: 10px; ">SPANDEF SPAN=SPAN1,RESOURCE=SYSPLEX.PLEX1.RALXT1;</li>
    </ul>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Thus, an operator with span SPAN1 started can display resource<br>
    SYSPLEX.PLEX1.RALXT1 in a view.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b>Example 2:</b> If UserSpanName is null and DisplayResourceName has a value (in<br>
    other words, DisplayResourceName is not null), the DisplayResourceName field<br>
    determines span authorization for the resource. For example, a monitorable</p><hr><hr>


<p style="padding-left: 6%;">resource in RODM has a MyName value of SYSPLEX.PLEX1.RALXT1 and a<br>
    DisplayResourceName value of RALXT1. The UserSpanName is null. The following<br>
    statement is defined in the NetView span table:</p>
<ul class="c">
    <li style="font-size: 10px; ">SPANDEF SPAN=SPAN1,RESOURCE=RALXT1;</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">An operator with span SPAN1 started can display this resource in a view. Because<br>
    DisplayResourceName is not null and the resource is not a shadow object, the<br>
    DisplayResourceName field determines span authorization.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">In this situation, it is useful to use a wildcard in the resource definition. If the<br>
    statement is defined in the NetView span table instead of the previous statements,<br>
    an operator with span SPAN1 started can display this resource whether or not the<br>
    DisplayResourceName value is RALXT1. If the DisplayResourceName is null, the<br>
    MyName value of SYSPLEX.PLEX1.RALXT1 is used to determine span authorization.<br>
    For example:</p>
<ul class="c">
    <li style="font-size: 10px; ">SPANDEF SPAN=SPAN1,RESOURCE=*RALXT1;</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b>Example 3:</b> The DisplayResourceName is used to create the resource names<br>
    displayed in views. While the DisplayResourceName value can be useful to<br>
    describe resources displayed within views, it might not be useful when<Br>
    determining span authorization. This value can be overridden by setting the<br>
    UserSpanName field. The DisplayResourceName is still displayed in views, but the<br>
    UserSpanName value is used for span authorization.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">For example, a monitorable resource in RODM has:</p>
 <ul class="c">
    <li>A MyName value of SYSPLEX.PLEX1.RALXT1</li>
    <li>A DisplayResourceName value of RALXT1</li>
    <li>A UserSpanName value of BUILDING500.RALXT1</li>
    </ul>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">A UserSpanName value of BUILDING500.RALXT1</p>
<ul class="c">
<li style="font-size: 10px; ">SPANDEF SPAN=SPAN1,RESOURCE=BUILDING500.*;</li>
 </ul>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Now suppose one of the following statements was defined in the NetView span<br>
    table instead of the previous statement:</p>
<ul class="c">
    <li style="font-size: 10px; ">SPANDEF SPAN=SPAN1,RESOURCE=SYSPLEX.PLEX1.RALXT1;</li>
    <li style="font-size: 10px; ">SPANDEF SPAN=SPAN1,RESOURCE=RALXT1;</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">In this case, the operator is denied span authorization to the resource. Because<br>
    UserSpanName has a value, it is used to determine span authorization for the<bR>
    resource. DisplayResourceName and MyName are not used to determine span<br>
    authorization when UserSpanName has a value.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 3%; font-size: 16px;"><b>Helpful Hints</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Occasionally, your resource, view, and span definitions do not yield the results you<br>
    expect. The following sections describe some helpful hints that you can use in<br>
    debugging unexpected conditions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b>No Views in the View List Are in the Operator's Span-of-Control</b><br>
    If span-of-control is applied to views at the view level, all views are span checked<br>
    before they are opened and in most cases, before they are put in a view list. If</p><hr><hr>

    
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">none of the views in the view list are in the operator's span-of-control, depending<br>
    on the NGMFVSPN value, an informational message is issued that indicates why a<br>
    view list is not returned.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b>No Resource in the View Is in the Operator's Span-of-Control</b><br>
    If span-of-control is applied to views at the resource level, all resources in a view<br>are span checked before the view is opened. If none of the resources in the view<br>
    are in the operator's span-of-control, an informational message is issued that<br>
    indicates why the view is not opened.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b>Selected Object Is Not in the Operator's Span-of-Control</b><br>
    If a locate resource is requested for a resource that is not in the operator's<bR>
    span-of-control, an informational message is issued that indicates why a view is<br>
    not opened.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Similarly, if views (such as, more detail views) are requested for a selected resource<br>
    in an open view but that resource is no longer in the operator's span-of-control, an<br>
    informational message is issued that indicates why the view is not opened. This<br>
    situation can occur only when one of the following conditions is true:</p>

<ul class="c">
    <li>The operator stopped the span to which the resource had been defined in the<br>
        NetView span table.</li>
    <li>The NetView span table was changed (and subsequently refreshed) such that the<br>
        resource is no longer defined to a span that the operator has started.</li>

</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Resources are not removed from open views when the NetView span table is<br>
    changed or because spans are started or stopped. These changes are made when<br>
    the open view is refreshed.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b>Changing the NGMFVSPN Attribute</b><br>
    The NGMFVSPN attribute that is assigned in the profile of the NetView<br>
    management console operator remains in effect for the duration of the session of<br>
    that operator. A changed NGMFVSPN attribute is retrieved only if the NetView<br>
    operator signs off and signs back on with the new NGMFVSPN attribute and the<br>
    NetView management console operator signs off and signs back on after the<br>
    NetView operator is signed back on.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Because of this restriction, a change to the NGMFVSPN attribute does not affect<br>
    open NetView management console views. All NetView management console<br>
    views are refreshed after the operator signs back on.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b>RACF Is Used for RODM Security</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">If you are using RACF for RODM security, ensure that the NetView domain name<br>
    is defined to RACF and has a minimum of RODM security level 2. If these security<br>
    requirements are not satisfied, RODM queries can fail, resulting in span<br>
    authorization errors.</p>
<hr style="color: black; background-color: black; height: 1px;">
<p style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Applying Span-of-Control to Set and Clear Operator Status</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Span of control is applied to the following subset of Set operator status and Clear<br>
    operator status actions:</p>
<ul class="c">
    <li>Marker</li>
    <li>Suspended, manually clear</li>
    <li>Suspended, automatically clear</li>
</ul>
<p  >If the operator has an access level of UPDATE(U) to a span-of-control, a marker or<br>
    suspend action for a selected resource in the span is completed and the operator</p><hr><hr>


<p style="padding-left: 6%;">status is set or cleared as requested by the operator. An access level of UPDATE(U)<br>
    is required for marker and suspend actions for resources in a span-of-control.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">If the operator has only an access level of READ(R) to a span-of-control containing<br>
    the resource or if the resource is not in a span accessed by the operator, the marker<br>
    or suspend action for the selected resource is ignored.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Marker or suspend actions against VTAM resources, including shadow objects, is<br>
    span checked similar to the way they are for commands. If you are using the<br>
    NetView span table, span checking for marker and suspend actions for RODM<br>
    objects utilizes the hierarchy of the UserSpanName, DisplayResourceName and<br>
    MyName fields.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Marker and suspend actions are not optional for span-of-Control. If span-of-control<br>
    is implemented, an active span for an operator must contain UPDATE(U) access<br>
    for the resource receiving the marker or suspend action.</p>
<ul class="c">
    <li>For more information about the hierarchy of the UserSpanName,<br>
        DisplayResourceName, and MyName fields, see “Resources” on page 116.</li>
    <li>For more information about using spans to protect resources, see the <i>IBM Tivoli<br>
        NetView for z/OS Security Reference.</i></li>
</ul>
<hr style="height: 1px; color: black; background-color: black;">
<p style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Applying Policy to Views</b></p>

<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Using NMCSTATUS policy definitions, you can define time schedules for resources<br>
    in NetView management console views. With these schedules, policy is applied to<br>
    views to specify when the displayable status of one or more resources in a view is<br>
    disabled at the NetView management console or when one or more resources in a<br>
    view is suspended from aggregation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">When your NMCSTATUS policy definitions are processed, CHRON timers are set<br>
    to indicate when the policy is activated and deactivated. Each policy definition<br>
    specifies a group of resources and actions to be applied to that group of resources<br>
    during the specified time period.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">When the beginning timer pops, the policy is activated. The NMCSTATUS policy<br>
    code creates a RODM object in the Aggregate_Collection_Class to represent the<br>
    policy definition. This triggers the RODM Collection Manager to create an<br>
    aggregate object in the GMFHS_Aggregate_Objects_Class to represent the collection<br>
    of resource objects based on the RODM field values of the object in the<br>
    Aggregate_Collection_Class. Resources belonging to the collection are linked to the<br>
    aggregate by way of the AggregateParent/AggregateChild and<br>
    ComposedOfLogical/IsPartOf fields. The actions specified on the policy definition<br>
    are applied to all resources in the collection.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">When the ending timer pops, the policy is deactivated. The NMCSTATUS policy<br>
    code deletes the RODM object from the Aggregate_Collection_Class. This triggers<br>
    the RODM Collection Manager to delete the corresponding aggregate object in the<br>
    GMFHS_Aggregate_Objects_Class representing the collection of resource objects<br>
    belonging to the policy. Any resource object matching the collection is removed<br>
    from the collection. Status updates are resumed and suspended resources are<br>
    unsuspended based on the policy definition. If the resource object belongs to<br>
    another active policy it is not removed from the collection. See “Resources<br>
    Belonging to Multiple Policies” on page 123 for more information.</p><hr><hr>


<p style="padding-left: 4%;"><b>Representing Policy Definitions in RODM</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Each active policy is represented in RODM by an object in the<br>
    Aggregate_Collection_Class. Values from the NMCSTATUS keywords are used to<br>
    set RODM fields on the object. The following list shows the key fields on the object<br>
    and how the value is derived from the policy definition.<br>
    <b>MyName</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 8%;">The name of the object is created by concatenating the timer handle of the<br>
    CHRON timer that popped, to indicate the beginning of the policy, with<br>
    the name of the policy definition. For example, if timer handle NMC1 is<br>
    the beginning timer for policy definition POLICY1, the MyName field of<br>
    the RODM object is set to NMC1POLICY1.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b>CollectionSpec1</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 8%;">The RODM Collection Manager language that specifies the collection of<br>
    resources is generated from the CLASS, MYNAME and RESOURCE<br>
    keywords or the BLDVIEWSSPEC keyword or the COLLECTIONSPEC<br>
    keyword. CollectionSpec1 contains 32K of data. If the value is greater than<br>
    32K, the additional data is stored in RODM fields CollectionSpec2,<br>
    CollectionSpec3, or CollectionSpec4, as needed. Each of these fields also<br>
    contain 32K of data and are defined in the GMFHS data model<br>
    (DUIFSTRC).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b>RequestFlags</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 8%;">Indicates which actions apply to the policy. If keyword<br>
    SUSPENDAGG=YES is specified, the action suspends all the resources in<br>
    the collection. If keyword STOPUPDATE=YES is specified, the action<br>
    disables system status updates at the NetView management console for<br>
    resources in the collection. Both actions can be applied to the same<br>
    collection of resources.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 2%; font-size: 16px;"><b>Resources Belonging to Multiple Policies</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">A resource can be defined to multiple policy definitions. A count of the number of<br>
    active policies the resource belongs to is saved in a counter field. Each displayable<br>
    resource object has two counter fields defined:<br>
    <b>PolicyCtrSU</b><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Represents the number of active policies this resource belongs to where the<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;action applied to the resource is stop updates. <br>
    <b>PolicyCtrSA</b><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Represents the number of active policies this resource belongs to where the<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;action applied to the resource is suspend aggregation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">These fields ensure that actions are not removed from a resource belonging to<br>
    other active policies. When a resource is removed from a policy, the applicable<br>
    counter is decreased by one. When the counter is zero, the action is removed from<br>the resource. If the counter is not zero, the resource belongs to another active<br>
    policy and the action remains in place.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b>Example 1:</b> POLICY1 specifies status updates sh not be sent to resource ABC on<br>

<p style="padding-left: 3%;"><b>Resources Suspended from Aggregation Due to Policy</b></p>
  <p style="padding-left: 6%;">When a real resource is suspended from aggregation because of a scheduled policy<br>

        <li>The suspend flag of the resource is set.</li>
        <li>The suspend flag note of the resource is set to <i>Scheduled.</i></li>
        <li>One is added to the PolicyCtrSA of the resource.</li>
    </ul>

<p style="padding-left: 6%;">When aggregation is resumed for a real resource because of a policy definition, the<br>
    resource is removed from the collection representing the policy and the following<br>
    actions occur in GMFHS:</p>
<ul class="c">
    <li>The suspend flag of the resource is cleared.</li>
    <li>The suspend flag note of the resource is cleared.</li>
    <li>One is subtracted from the PolicyCtrSA of the resource.</li>
</ul>

<p style="padding-left: 6%;">The suspend flag is cleared only if the value of the note is "Scheduled" and was set<bR>
    by operator ID GMFHS.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">If a policy definition specifies SUSPENDAGG=YES and STOPUPDATE=NO, the<br>
    affected resources do not change to the Scheduled system status. The resources are<br>
    suspended from aggregation but continue to receive system status updates.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">A NetView management console operator can override the setting of the suspend<br>
    flag. See “Resources Belonging to Multiple Policies” on page 123 for more<br>
    information.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 3%;"><b>Suspending Aggregation Using an Aggregate</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">When an aggregate is suspended from aggregation, the aggregate itself is not<br>
    suspended from aggregation. Instead, all of the real objects currently reporting<br>
    status to the aggregate are suspended from aggregation. The following actions<bR>
    occur in GMFHS:</p>
<ul class="c">
    <li>The suspend flag of the real resource is set.</li>
    <li>The suspend flag of the real resource note is set to <i>Scheduled.</i></li>
    <li>One is added to the PolicyCtrSA of the real resource.</li>
    <li>The suspended flag of the aggregate child is set.</li>
    <li>The suspended flag note of the aggregate child is set to <i>Scheduled.</i></li>
</ul><hr><hr>

<p style="padding-left: 6%;">The child suspended flag is also set for any aggregates in the AggregateChild/<br>
    AggregateParent path between the aggregate affected by policy and the real<br>
    resources reporting status to that aggregate. However the child suspended flag<br>
    note field is not set to <i>Scheduled</i> for these intermediate aggregate resources.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">When aggregation is resumed for an aggregate, the aggregate itself is not resumed.<br>
    Instead aggregation is resumed for all of the real objects currently reporting status<br>
    to the aggregate. The following actions occur in GMFHS:</p>

<ul class="c">
    <li>The suspend flag of the real resource is cleared</li>
    <li>The suspend flag of the real resource note is cleared.</li>
    <li>One is subtracted from the PolicyCtrSA of the real resource.</li>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resource AGG1 is added to the collection and the action (suspending<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aggregation) is applied to the resource. Suspending an aggregate from<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aggregation is a shortcut request to suspend all real resources currently<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reporting status to the aggregate from aggregation. The PolicyCtrSA field of<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each real resource is increased by one. The PolicyCtrSA field of the aggregate is<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not updated because the aggregate itself is not suspended.<br>
    2. Saturday at 11:59:59 p.m., a timer pops and AGGPOLICY is deactivated.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aggregate resource AGG1 is removed from the collection and the action<bR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(suspending aggregation) is removed from each resource. Unsuspending an<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aggregate from aggregation is a shortcut request to resume aggregation for all<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;real resources currently reporting status to the aggregate. The PolicyCtrSA field<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of each real resource is decreased by one. The PolicyCtrSA field of the<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aggregate is not updated because the aggregate itself was never suspended and<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can not be unsuspended.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">If additional real resources begin to report status to aggregate AGG1 after the<bR>
    policy is activated, they are not suspended by the policy definition AGGPOLICY.<br> Actions can only be applied to a member of the collection. The real resources are<br>

    view.</p><hr><hr>


<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">When system status updates are no longer sent to a resource because of a<br>

    <li>One is added to the PolicyCtrSU field of the resource.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">Any system status updates received for this resource while it belongs to an active<br>

    collection representing the policy. The following actions occur in GMFHS.</p>
<ul class="c"> 
    <li>One is subtracted from the PolicyCtrSU field of the resource.</li>
    <li>v If the PolicyCtrSU field=0, then the DisplayStatus field is set to the current value<br>

        update to change the resource from <i>Scheduled</i> status to its current system status.</li>
    <li>If the PolicyCtrSU field is greater than zero, the DisplayStatus field remains<br>

<hr style="color: black; background-color: black; height: 1px;">
<p style="font-size: 16px; "><b>Aggregation Concepts</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">This section describes aggregation for network resources. The topology of network<br>
    resources is managed by RODM. Network resources, including aggregate<br>
    resources, are displayed in NetView management console views, based on<bR>
    information gathered by GMFHS.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; padding-left: 3%;"><b>Aggregation Overview</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">Aggregation is the process of creating, connecting, and updating the status of<br>
    aggregate objects. Aggregate objects represent a collection of real objects. A real object<br>
    represents an actual resource. Aggregate objects do not correspond to real, physical<br>
    devices. Aggregate objects provide two types of information about the real objects<br>
    associated with them:</p>
<ul class="c">
    <li>Connectivity information for fast path to failing resource views. For more<br>
        information about these views, see “NMC Locate Failing Resources Views” on<br>
        page 92.</li>
    <li>A single DisplayStatus (also referred to as status) representation for the group of<br>
        real objects based on a set of rules.</li>
</ul><hr><hr>

<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">Both aggregate and real objects can exist under any class within RODM. GMFHS<br>
    uses the ResourceTraits field to determine whether an object is an aggregate or real<br>
    object. The ResourceTraits field is of data type INDEXLIST and can have multiple<br>
    values; all values are padded to eight characters with blanks. The GMFHS, SNA<br>
    topology manager, and MultiSystem Manager data models set the ResourceTraitsM<br>
    field at the class level for both real and aggregate classes. When an aggregate<br>
    object is created, the value AGG is set in the ResourceTraits field to indicate that<br>
    the object is an aggregate object. Similarly, when a real object is created, the value<br>
    REAL is set in the ResourceTraits field to indicate that the object is a real object. An<br>
    object cannot have both values in the ResourceTraits field; that is, it cannot be both<br>
    a real and an aggregate object.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">In Figure 31 on page 130, objects labeled <i>A</i> represent aggregate objects and objects<br>
    labeled <i>R</i> represent real objects.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">The <i>aggregation</i> level of an object is the number of aggregate objects traversed in an<br>
    aggregation path, including the current aggregate object. The aggregation level of<br>
    real objects is always 0. For example, in Figure 31 on page 130, the aggregation<br>
    level of R4 is always 0. The aggregation level of A34 is 2 on the<br>
    R10→A41→A34→A22→A12 path, and it is 1 on the R9→A34→A22→A12 path. The<br>
    aggregation level of A35 is always 1.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">For an object in the aggregation hierarchy that has no aggregate children, an<br>
    <i>aggregation path</i> defines a unique traversal of the aggregation hierarchy using the<bR>
    AggregationParent field. The path includes only one object at each level of the<br>
    hierarchy, and continues until the current object in the path has no aggregate<bR>
    parents. For example, in Figure 31 on page 130, R8→A32→A21→A12 form an<br>
    aggregation path. R8→A33→A22→A12 form another aggregation path that begins and<bR>
    ends with the same objects.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">An <i>aggregate</i> child is a real or aggregate object that is linked by the<br>
    AggregationChild field. This link can be either direct (also referred to as<bR>
    immediate) or indirect. A direct child is a real or aggregate object that is directly<br>
    linked to the AggregationChild field of an object. An indirect child is a real or<br>
    aggregate object that can be reached by following the chain of AggregationChild<br>
    links through the aggregation hierarchy starting from the direct child of an object.<br>
    For example, in Figure 31 on page 130, the direct children of A21 are R3, R4, A31<br>
    and A32. An indirect child of A12 is R9. The indirect children of A22 are R8, R9,<bR>
    R10, R11, R12, R13, and A41.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">An <i>aggregate parent</i> is an aggregate object that is linked to an object by the<br>
    AggregationParent field. This link can be either direct (also referred to as<bR>
    immediate) or indirect. A direct parent is any aggregate object that is directly<bR>
    linked to the AggregationParent field of an object. An indirect parent is an<br>
    aggregate object that can be reached by following the chain of AggregationParent<br>
    links through the aggregation hierarchy starting from the direct parent of an object.<br>
    For example, in Figure 31 on page 130, direct parents of R1 are A11 and A12. The<br>
    direct parent of A34 is A22. An indirect parent of R11 is A12. The indirect parents<bR>
    of A41 are A22 and A12.</p><hr><hr>

<p style="padding-left: 3%; font-size: 16px;"><b>Creating an Aggregation Hierarchy</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">An aggregation hierarchy is the topology of aggregate and underlying real objects.<br>
    The aggregation hierarchy is built using the AggregationParent and<bR>
    AggregationChild fields of the objects.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">Although real objects are part of an aggregation hierarchy, an aggregation<br>
    hierarchy does not exist until at least one aggregate object is created in RODM.<br>
    Figure 31 is one example of an aggregation hierarchy. An aggregation hierarchy is<bR>
    defined by the following rules:</p>
<ul class="c">
    <li>For each path in the hierarchy, the least significant child of the path can be<br>
        either a real or an aggregate object. A least <i>significant child</i> is a real or aggregate<bR>
        object that has no aggregation children and therefore begins zero or more<br>
        aggregation paths. For example, in Figure 31, R2, R7 and A35 are examples of<br>
        least significant children.</li>
    <li>For each path in the hierarchy, the most significant parent of the path must be<br>
        an aggregate object. A most <i>significant parent</i> is an aggregate object that has no<br>
        aggregation parents and therefore ends one or more aggregation paths. For<bR>
        example, in Figure 31, A11 and A12 are examples of most significant parents. A<br>
        real object can never be the most significant parent because a real object must<br>
        have at least one aggregate parent to be considered part of the aggregation<br>
        hierarchy. For example, in Figure 31, R14 is not part of the aggregation hierarchy<br>
        because it does not have an aggregate parent.</li>
    <li>A real object cannot be an aggregate parent.</li>
    <li>There is no restriction on the number of levels in an aggregation hierarchy. The<br>
        number of levels in an aggregation hierarchy is equal to the number of levels in<br>
        the longest aggregation path in the hierarchy.</li><br>

<p><b>Note:</b> Aggregation priority functions are restricted to 9 levels of aggregation. For<br>
    more information, see “Aggregation Priority” on page 135.</p>
<li>An object can be the direct child of more than one aggregate object, and an<br>
    aggregate object can have more than one direct child. R1 is a direct child of both<br>
    A11 and A12. R3, R4, A31 and A32 are direct children of A21.</li>
<li>For GMFHS to perform aggregation correctly, there must be no aggregation<br>
    hierarchy loops. An aggregation hierarchy loop exists when an aggregate object is a</li><hr><hr>
    parent of itself. For example, A12 c not be a child of A33. This results in the path<br>
    A12→A33→A22→A12→A33→A22..., which loops indefinitely.<br>
<li>A parent-child relationship can exist between objects on more than one path. For<br>
    each path, the child appears to be a unique object to the parent. For example, in<br>
    Figure 31 on page 130, R8 and A12 belong to the same two aggregation paths:<br>
    R8→A32→A21→A12 and R8→A33→A22→A12. From the perspective of A12, R8 is two<br>
    separate real objects that have identical characteristics.</li>
<li>All objects in the aggregation hierarchy need not be interconnected. For example,<br>
    another subset of the aggregation hierarchy can be composed of objects that<br>
    form a hierarchy similar to that shown in Figure 31 on page 130, but with no<br>
    common objects between the two subsets of the hierarchy. The hierarchy subsets<br>
    together form the entire aggregation hierarchy</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 3%; font-size: 16px;"><b>Building the Aggregation Hierarchy in RODM</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Objects can be linked to or unlinked from the aggregation hierarchy at any time.<br>
    The aggregation hierarchy is created using two RODM fields: AggregationParent<br>
    and AggregationChild. For a description of these fields, see the IBM Tivoli NetView<br>
    for z/OS Data Model Reference. The fields are of RODM type OBJECTLINKLIST. For<br>
    any object, the AggregationParent field contains links to all of the direct parent<br>
    objects. The AggregationChild field contains links to all of the direct child objects.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">In Figure 32, the AggregationParent field of R2 contains links to two objects, A11<br>
    and A12. The AggregationParent field of A22 contains links to one object, A12. The<bR>
    AggregationChild field of A22 contains links to three objects: A33, A34, and A35.</p>
<img style="padding-left: 5%;" src="C:\Users\my pc\OneDrive\Desktop\html1/(101-200)pc14.jpg">
<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><i>Figure 32. Links Between AggregationChild and AggregationParent Fields</i></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">For GMFHS to perform aggregation correctly, the link or unlink of the<br>
    AggregationParent and AggregationChild fields of two objects must be performed</p><hr><hr>


<p style="padding-left: 6%;">by method DUIFCUAP. RODM does not prevent this operation or issue a warning<br>
    if the operation is done without using the DUIFCUAP method; however, status<br>
    values of all aggregate objects above the child object being linked or unlinked<br>
    cannot be correctly calculated if this method is not used. Method DUIFCUAP also<br>
    prevents aggregation hierarchy loops. GMFHS performs unpredictably if an<br>
    aggregation hierarchy loop is introduced into the aggregation hierarchy. For more<br>
    information about how to use method DUIFCUAP, see “DUIFCUAP: Update<br>
    Aggregation Path Method” on page 499.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Using RODM methods and notifications, the aggregation hierarchy can be<br>
    modified at any time. Whole sections of the hierarchy can be linked or unlinked.<bR>
    For example, in Figure 31 on page 130, A34 can be unlinked from A22 and linked<bR>
    to A31. This procedure has no effect on the status of A11 because the same objects<br>
    still report to A11. However, the logical group of objects reporting to A21, A31, and<br>
    A22 has changed as a result of the hierarchy change, and the statuses of these<br>
    aggregate objects can be different. GMFHS dynamically handles these hierarchy<br>
    changes when a link or unlink is done using the DUIFCUAP method.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b>Note:</b> A12 can experience a temporary status change, depending on the length of<br>
    time between the unlinking and relinking of A34.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 3%; font-size: 16px;"><b>Updating Status</b></p>

<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Aggregation is performed on an aggregation hierarchy from the time that the first<br>
    AggregationParent to AggregationChild link occurs to the time that the last<bR>
    AggregationParent from AggregationChild unlink occurs. The central purpose of<br>
    aggregation is to keep the statuses of all aggregate objects in the aggregation<br>
    hierarchy accurate at all times. The statuses of the aggregate objects are determined<br>
    by collecting the status of all real object children under an aggregate object, and<br>
    then performing a set of aggregation rules on the collected statuses using RODM<br>fields defined on both the aggregate and real objects.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; font-size: 16px;"><b>How Status Affects Aggregation</b><br>
    Only the statuses of real object children contribute to the status value of an,<br>
    aggregate parent. The statuses of child aggregate objects do not contribute to the<br>
    statuses of parent aggregate objects, because these objects do not represent a real<br>
    entity. For example, in Figure 31 on page 130, real object children R10, R11, R12,<br>
    and R13 contribute statuses to aggregate objects A41 and A34; however, object A41<br>
    does not contribute status to aggregate object A34.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">The aggregation process can be summarized as follows:<br>
    1. An event occurs that affects the status of aggregate objects in the aggregation<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hierarchy. See “Events That Start the Aggregation Process” on page 138. for<BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more information.
    2. Gather the statuses of all real objects that affect the aggregate objects.<br>
    3. Calculate the status of the aggregate object as described in “Using the<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DisplayStatus of Real Objects.”
    4. Update the status of the aggregate object if it has changed.<br>
    5. Return to step 1 and wait for the next event.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; font-size: 16px;"><b>Using the DisplayStatus of Real Objects</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Although many RODM fields are used during the aggregation process, the<br>
    DisplayStatus field is central to this process. Step 3 of the aggregation process<br>
    listed under “How Status Affects Aggregation” uses the DisplayStatus field as<br>
    follows:</p><hr><hr>

<ul class="c">
    <li>Counts the number of children contributing to the XCPT group.</li>
    <li>For each object contributing to the XCPT group, further categorizes the object<br>
        into a number of status groups based on the status of the object.</li>
    <li>Counts the number of object children in each status group.</li>
    <li>Applies the aggregation rules listed in “Aggregation Rules” on page 137 to the<br>
        XCPT group and status group counts to determine the status of the aggregate<bR>
        object.</li>
    <li>Updates the status of the aggregate object if it has changed.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b>XCPT Groups and Status Groups:</b> Real objects can be members of the XCPT<br>
    group and in zero to eight status groups, depending on their status values. These<br>
    groups provide a way to prioritize and define the contribution of a real object to<br>
    the status of an aggregate object. The eight different status groups are STGRP1<br>
    (Status Group 1) through STGRP8.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">A real object is a member of an XCPT group, a status group, or both when the<br>
    status of the real object matches one of the status values defined for the group. The<bR>
    status values defined for each group are customizable. For more information about<br>
    defining XCPT and status group status values, see “Customizing the DisplayStatus<br>
    Mapping Table for Exception Views” on page 102.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">The XCPT group is used for exception view processing and aggregation<br>
    processing. For aggregation processing, the status of each real object under an<bR>
    aggregate object is used to categorize the real object as having been in an exception<br>
    (XCPT) or a non-exception (NOXCPT) state. All real objects in the XCPT state are<br>
    counted in the XCPT group. For more information about the XCPT group and the<br>
    status groups, see “Defining Exception View Objects and Criteria” on page 98.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b>Note:</b> For a real object to be further categorized into the 8 status groups, the real<br>
    object must also be counted in the XCPT group.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><i>Example:</i> In Figure 31 on page 130, aggregate A41 has real object children R10,<br>
    R11, R12, and R13. Assume the following DUIFSMTE statements are coded in the<br>
    DUIFSMT table:</p>
<img style="padding-left: 5%;" src="C:\Users\my pc\OneDrive\Desktop\html1/(101-200)pc15.jpg">
<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><i>Figure 33. Example DUIFSMTE Statements in Table DUIFSMT</i></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Also assume that the actual status values of the objects are:</p>
<ul class="c">
    <li>R10 is UNSAT</li>
    <li>R11 is DS140</li>
    <li>R12 is DS158</li>
    <li>R13 is UNKWN</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">In this example, all four resources are in an exception state and are counted in the<br>
    XCPT group. R10 is a member of status groups 1 and 6; R11 is a member of status</p><hr><hr>


<p style="padding-left: 6%;">group 5; R12 is a member of status groups 1 and 8; R13 is a member of status<br>
    group 8. For aggregate object A41, there are:</p>
<ul class="c">
    <li>Four real objects in the XCPT group.</li>
    <li>Two real objects in status groups 1 and 8.</li>
    <li>One real object in status groups 5 and 6.</li>
    <li>Zero real objects in status groups 2, 3, 4, and 7.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b>>Notes:</b>
    1. For any DUIFSMTE macro definition, the status values defined for each status<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;group sh be a subset of the status values defined for the XCPT group. An<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attempt to define a status group status value that is not also an XCPT group<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;status value is not prevented; however, it has no affect on aggregation status<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calculations.<bR>
    2. The first DUIFSMTE statement in Figure 33 on page 133 has a status value of<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DS158 defined for STGRP6. This is enabled by the DUIFSMTE statement, but a<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; status of DS158 is not counted toward STGRP6 because DS158 is not also in the<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XCPT group.<br>
    3. A status value in the XCPT group does not have to be defined as a status value<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in any of the status groups; a real object can contribute to the XCPT group<bR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without contributing to any of the status groups.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b>Suspended Resources:</b> Real objects can be temporarily removed from the,<br>
    aggregation hierarchy without actually changing the AggregationParent and<br>
    AggregationChild fields. This logical removal is referred to as suspending the object.<bR>
    The following techniques can be used to suspend objects:</p>

<ul class="c">
    <li>Using NetView management console, you can set the suspend flag of a resource<br>
        from the Resource Properties window or clear suspended resources from the List<br>
        of Suspended Resources window. For more information, see the NetView<br>
        management console online help.</li>
    <li>Using RODMView, you can set the UserStatus field directly in RODM, . For<br>
        more information, see the <i>IBM Tivoli NetView for z/OS Data Model Reference.</i></li>

</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Real objects can be suspended by an operator for any reason. In most cases, the<br>
    object is suspended when problem resolution for the real resource represented by<br>
    the object is being done. The object is said to be resumed when it is logically placed<bR>
    back into the aggregation hierarchy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">GMFHS uses the SuspendedCount field to track the number of resources that have<br>
    been suspended. A real resource does not contribute status to its aggregation<bR>
    parents if one of the following actions occurred:</p>
<ul class="c">
    <li>The suspend flag of the UserStatus field is on.</li>
    <li>The AggregationPriorityValue field has a value of -1 (Ignore).</li>
    <li>The AggregationPriorityValue field has a value of -2 (Resource type default).<br>
        The DefaultAggregationPriorityCopy field contains a copy of the value in the<br>
        DefaultAggregationPriorityValue field of the Display_Resource_Type_Class<br>
        object that is linked to the DisplayResourceType field of the real object. If the<bR>
        DefaultAggregationPriorityCopy field is -1 (Ignore) and the<br>
        AggregationPriorityValue field is -2 (Resource type default), this resource does<br>
        not participate in status calculations for aggregation.</li>
</ul>

<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b>Note:</b> Setting the AggregationPriorityValue or DefaultAggregationPriorityValue<br>
    fields to -1 (Ignore) does not affect the suspend flag of the UserStatus field. These<bR>
    actions are independent of each other and do not cause the other to occur.</p><hr><hr>

<p style="padding-left: 6%; font-size: 16px;"><b>Calculating the Aggregate Parent Status</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">After categorizing the status of each real object child into the XCPT group and<br>
    status groups, and then counting the number of real object children in each group<br>
    for a particular aggregate object, independent methods are used to calculate the<br>
    status of an aggregate object. Aggregation rules are then used to resolve any<br>
    conflicting status results produced by each of the methods.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Aggregation Thresholds: The status of an aggregate parent is determined based,<br>
    on whether the XCPT group count is above or below a threshold value. There are<br>
    three threshold values defined as RODM fields on all aggregate objects. The values<br>
    are listed below in order of severity: :</p>
<ul class="c">
    <li>ThresholdDegraded (lowest severity)</li>
    <li>ThresholdSeverelyDegraded</li>
    <li>ThresholdUnsatisfactory (highest severity)</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">A threshold is met if the XCPT group count for an aggregate object is greater than<br>
    or equal to the threshold value. The ThresholdSeverelyDegraded value must be<br>
    less than or equal to the ThresholdUnsatisfactory value, and the<bR>
    ThresholdDegraded value must be less than or equal to the<br>
    ThresholdSeverelyDegraded value.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">The valid values for these fields are described in the <i>IBM Tivoli NetView for z/OS<bR>
    Data Model Reference.</i> The values are as follows:</p>
<ul class="c">
    <li>A value of -2 indicates that the value of the default field from the<br>
        Display_Resource_Type_Class object (either DefaultThresholdDegraded,<br>
        DefaultThresholdSeverelyDegraded, or DefaultThresholdUnsatisfactory) is used<br>
        to define the threshold value. The default values can be -1, 0, or any positive<br>
        integer. These default values substitute directly for the actual threshold values.</li>
    <li>A value of -1 in the threshold field indicates that this threshold calculation is<br>
        disabled for the aggregate object.</li>
    <li>A value of 0 in the threshold field indicates that the object always changes to the<br>
        threshold status, no matter what the XCPT group count for the aggregate parent<br>
        is. If more than one threshold has a 0 value, then the highest priority threshold<br>
        takes effect.</li>
    <li>A positive number indicates that the XCPT group count must be equal to or<br>
        greater than the number to cause the aggregate object to change to the threshold<br>
        status value. The highest priority threshold that meets this condition is the<br>
        threshold that is used to apply the status.</li>
    <li>A value between -100 and -200 (inclusive) in the threshold field indicates that<br>
        the XCPT group count must be equal to or greater than the following value:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(value + 100) × (total number of real objects reporting to the aggregate) × 0.01<br>
        In effect, the value is a percentage of the total number of real objects currently<br>
        attached to the aggregate object.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b>Aggregation Priority:</b> Aggregation priority allows real objects to be designated as<br>
    critical resources. If a critical resource contributes to the XCPT group of an<br>
    aggregate parent, this constitutes an automatic match with the degraded threshold.<br>
    Additional critical resources that contribute to the XCPT group has no additional<br>
    effect. When the last critical resource no longer contributes to the XCPT group, the<br>
    degraded threshold is no longer matched.</p><hr><hr>

<p style="padding-left: 6%;">The AggregationPriorityValue field is defined on all real objects and it is used to<br>
    define a real object as a critical resource. The valid values for this field are<br>
    described in the <i>IBM Tivoli NetView for z/OS Data Model Reference.</i> Generally, the<br>
    values are:</p>
<ul class="c">
    <li>A value of -2 indicates that the value of the default field from the<br>
        Display_Resource_Type_Class objects DefaultAggregationPriorityValue field is to<br>
        be used to define the priority value. The default values can be -1, 0, or any<br>
        positive number in the range of 1–9. These default values substitute directly for<br>
        the actual priority values.</li>
    <li>A value of -1 indicates that the real object is suspended from aggregation.</li>
    <li>A value of 0 indicates that the real object is not a critical resource.</li>
    <li>A positive number from 1 through 9 indicates that the real object is a critical<br>
        resource. The number also indicates the number of levels up the aggregation<br>
        hierarchy to which this object contributes its critical nature if the object does<br>
        contribute to the XCPT group. The critical nature of a resource cannot be<br>
        propagated more than 9 levels up the aggregation hierarchy.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b>Note:</b> An aggregation hierarchy can have any number of levels. A real object is<br>
    counted in the XCPT group for any aggregate at any level of the hierarchy.<br> However, if the object is also a critical resource, the critical nature only be<br>
    propagates a maximum of 9 levels above the real object. Therefore, there is a<br>
    degraded threshold match for aggregate objects that are at a level less than or<br>
    equal to the level specified in the AggregationPriorityValue field.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b>Status Group Customization:</b> Both thresholding and priority aggregation allow<br>
    the status of a parent aggregate object to be set to one of five predetermined<br>
    values: Unknown, Satisfactory, Degraded, SeverelyDegraded, or Unsatisfactory.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">The eight status groups are used to customize the actual state of the aggregate<br>
    object. Status group customization is very similar to aggregation priority, without<br>
    the 9 level limit on the aggregation hierarchy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">With status group customization, the final status of the aggregate parent can be<br>
    customized to be a value other than one of the five predetermined values. All real<br>
    objects that are a member of a particular status group are counted. This is done for<br>
    each status group. If the number of real objects in a status group is greater than<br>
    zero, the status group definitions on the aggregate object are used to determine the<br>
    status of the aggregate object.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">The status groups are prioritized from STGRP1 (highest) to STGRP8 (lowest). If<br>
    more than one status group has a count greater than zero, and there is more than<br>
    one matching status group definition for the aggregate object, then the first status<br>
    value in the highest priority status group definition for the aggregate object is used<br>
    as the status for the aggregate object.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b>Unknown Resources:</b> The status values of real object children can contribute<br>
    directly to the status values of aggregate parents without necessarily contributing<br>
    to the XCPT group. The total number of real objects with Unknown statuses under<br>
    an aggregate parent is compared to the value in the UnknownThreshold field of<br>
    the Global_Aggregation_Parameters_Class. If this threshold is equaled or exceeded,<br>
    then further aggregation processing for this aggregate parent is not valid and the<br>
    status of the aggregate parent becomes Unknown.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Unlike the three thresholds defined under “Aggregation Thresholds” on page 135,<bR>
    this threshold is a number from 1 through 100 that represents a percentage. The<hr><hr>
    

<p style="padding-left: 6%;">percentage is applied to the total number of real children objects under the<bR>
    aggregate parent that are actively participating in aggregation (not suspended).</p>

<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Aggregation Rules: Suspended resources, unknown resources, aggregation<br>
    thresholds, aggregation priority, and status group customization are used to<br>
    calculate the status of an aggregate object. The following aggregation rules are<br>
    used in the order listed to resolve conflicts among the aggregation methods:<br>
    1. Logically remove suspended real object children from the aggregation<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hierarchy. This was already done by not allowing suspended real objects to be<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;counted in the XCPT and status groups, but the total count of all objects<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reporting to an aggregate parent is now changed to reflect the removal of the<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suspended resources.<br>
    2. If the total number of real object children is now zero, or if there is no<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DisplayResourceType object currently linked to the aggregate parent and a<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;default threshold from this object is needed, the status of the aggregate object is<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to Unknown and the status calculation ends.<br>
    3. If the percentage of real object children with an Unknown status is greater than<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbspthe UnknownThreshold, the status of the aggregate object is set to Unknown<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbspand the status calculation ends.<br>
    4. If there is a status group customization match with the aggregate object, the<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aggregate object takes on the first status defined in the highest matching status<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;group of the aggregate object. The status calculation ends.<br>
    5. If the number of real object children in the XCPT group is greater than or equal<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the Unsatisfactory threshold, the status of the aggregate object becomes<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsatisfactory and the status calculation ends. The Unsatisfactory threshold can<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be expressed as an absolute count or as a percentage.<br>
    6. If the number of real object children in an XCPT group is greater than or equal<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the SeverelyDegraded threshold, the status of the aggregate object becomes<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SeverelyDegraded and the status calculation ends. The ServerelyDegraded<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;threshold can be expressed as an absolute count or as a percentage.<br>
    7. If the number of real object children in an XCPT group is greater than or equal<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the Degraded threshold, the status of the aggregate object becomes Degraded<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the status calculation ends. The Degraded threshold can be expressed as an<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;absolute count or as a percentage.<br>
    8. If the number of real object children counted in the XCPT group that are critical<bR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resources is greater than zero, the status of the aggregate object becomes<bR>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Degraded and the status calculation ends. Remember that the<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AggregationPriorityValue field for any real object child might not allow it to be<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;counted as a critical resource for the current level of aggregate object.<br>
9. If none of the previous conditions apply, the status of the aggregate object<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;becomes Satisfactory and the status calculation ends.<br></p>

<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b>Aggregation Problems</b><br>
    Aggregation is accomplished using various RODM fields. Some of these fields can<br>
    be modified by the customer, and some are for GMFHS method use only. Although<bR>
    a customer sh never modify a field that is for GMFHS method use only, RODM<br>does not prevent this from happening.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Inconsistencies can arise when:</p>
<ul class="c">
    <li>Internal counts are not equal for each aggregate object</li>
    <li>Threshold values are greater than the total number of real object children of an<br>
        aggregate parent, or threshold values that do not follow the restrictions defined<br>
        in “Aggregation Thresholds” on page 135</li>
</ul><hr><hr>


<p style="padding-left: 6%;">An indicator in the UserStatus field is used to indicate possible inconsistencies<br>
    during aggregation processing.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b>UserStatus Field</b>
    The UserStatus field on an aggregate object contains information used to set the<br>
    operator status of the object in a view. There are five bits in the UserStatus field<br>
    that contribute to the operator status of an aggregate object:</p>
<ul class="c">
    <li>The resource marked bit</li>
    <li>The threshold inconsistency bit (set as a result of aggregation problems<br>
        described above)</li>
    <li>The suspended bit</li>
    <li>The resume bit</li>
    <li>The suspend resources under aggregate bit</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">The resource marked, suspended, resume, and suspend resources under aggregate<br>
    bits are set as a result of an operator action or by setting the UserStatus field<br>
    directly in RODM (using RODMView for example). The threshold inconsistency bit<bR>
    is set during the aggregation process if an inconsistency is detected.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; font-size: 16px;"><b>Events That Start the Aggregation Process</b><bR></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6%;">
    A number of events can start the aggregation process. In general, aggregation is<br>
    triggered based on a change to one of the RODM fields used for the aggregation<br>
    process. For example, a link is made using the AggregationParent and<br>
    AggregationChild field of two objects, or a DisplayStatus change occurs for a real<br>
    object in the aggregation hierarchy. The following topics describe each of the<br>
    events that trigger the aggregation process.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b>Changing the DisplayStatus of a Real Object:</b> This is the most common event<br>
    that triggers the aggregation process. The DisplayStatus value of a real object can<bR>
    change for a variety of reasons, such as a status change request from a NetView<br>
    management console or a NetView alert. Any time the status of a real object that is<br>
    a member of the aggregation hierarchy changes, the status of all aggregate parents<br>
    of that real object might also need to be changed.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">If the real object was suspended with the automatic resume feature and the status<bR>
    of the object is now Satisfactory, the object is logically relinked to the aggregation<br>
    hierarchy and aggregation for the object is resumed.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 6%;">If there is no change in the contribution of an object to the XCPT group or a status<br>
    group, and the object does not change to or from Unknown status, then there is no<bR>
    change to the aggregate parent status.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b>Linking and Unlinking Using Method DUIFCUAP:</b> The AggregationParent and<br>
    AggregationChild fields of the child object and parent object passed to the<bR>
    DUIFCUAP method are updated. Although a link or unlink operation involves<br>
    only two objects (the child object and the parent object), the action can affect the<br>
    status values of many aggregate objects in the aggregation hierarchy</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">After a link or unlink operation, the status of the immediate parent aggregate<br>
    object and all parent objects of the immediate parent aggregate object can need to<br>
    be changed.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b>Changing the AggregationPriorityValue:</b> If the AggregationPriorityValue of a real<br>
    object is changed, then the status of all aggregate parents of the real object might<bR>
    need to be changed. If the real object is not counted in the XCPT group for the</p><hr><hr>


<p style="padding-left: 6%;">aggregate parent object, there is no change to the aggregate parent status. The<br>
    following techniques can be used to change the value of the<br>
    AggregationPriorityValue field:</p>
<ul class="c">
    <li>Use the NetView management console workstation. For more information, see in<br>
        the <i>IBM Tivoli NetView for z/OS User's Guide: NetView Management Console.</i></li>
    <li>Use NetView management console. For more information, see the NetView<br>
        management console online help.</li>
    <li>Set the AggregationPriorityValue field directly in RODM (using RODMView, for<br>
        example). For more information, see the <i>IBM Tivoli NetView for z/OS Data Model<bR>
        Reference.</i></li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b>Changing an Aggregate Object Threshold:</b> If any of these thresholds are<br>
    changed, the status of that specific aggregate object might need to be changed. The<br>
    following techniques can be used to change the value of the ThresholdDegraded,<br>
    ThresholdSeverelyDegraded, and ThresholdUnsatisfactory fields:</p>

<ul class="c">
    <li>Use NetView management console. For more information, see the NetView<br>
        management console online help.</li>
    <li>Set the fields directly in RODM (using RODMView, for example). For more<br>
        information, see the <i>IBM Tivoli NetView for z/OS Data Model Reference.</i></li>

Changing the Unknown Threshold: If this threshold is changed, the status of all<br>
    aggregate objects in the aggregation hierarchy might need to be changed. Two<bR>
    techniques can be used to change the value of the UnknownThreshold field of the<br>
    Global_Aggregation_Parameters_Class:
<li>By setting the UnknownThreshold field directly in RODM (using RODMView<br>
    for example). For more information, see the <i>IBM Tivoli NetView for z/OS Data<br>
    Model Reference.</i></li><br>
<b>Note:</b> You cannot use NetView management console to change the value of the<bR>
    UnknownThreshold field.
<b>Suspending a Real Object:</b> If a resource is suspended, the status of all aggregate<br>
    parents of that real object might need to be changed. A real object can be<bR>
    suspended from participating in aggregation at the workstation. The following<bR>
    techniques can be used to suspend a real object from participating in aggregation:
<li>Use NetView management console. For more information, see the NetView<br>
    management console online help.</li>
<li>Set the UserStatus field directly in RODM (using RODMView, for example). For<bR>
    more information, see <i>IBM Tivoli NetView for z/OS Data Model Reference.</i></li>

</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Changing Resource Type Defaults: The AggregationPriorityValue field for a real<br>
    object can indicate that the value of the DefaultAggregationPriorityValue field from<br>the Display_Resource_Type_Class object linked to the real object sh be used for<br>
    priority aggregation. The ThresholdDegraded, ThresholdSeverelyDegraded, and<bR>
    ThresholdUnsatisfactory fields for aggregate objects can indicate that the value of<bR>
    the default fields from the Display_Resource_Type_Class object linked to the<br>
    aggregate object sh be used for threshold aggregation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">For a real or aggregate object using these defaults, the effect is the same as if the<br>
    priority value or threshold field directly on the object had changed. The primary<br>
    difference is that multiple real or aggregate objects can be changed because a<br>
    Display_Resource_Type_Class object can be linked to multiple objects.</p><hr><hr>


<p style="padding-left: 6%;">The following techniques can be used to change the value of the<br>
    ThresholdDegraded, ThresholdSeverelyDegraded, and ThresholdUnsatisfactory<bR>
    fields:</p>
<ul class=c>
    <li>Use NetView management console. For more information, see the NetView<br>
        management console online help.</li>
    <li>Set the field directly in RODM (using RODMView, for example). For more<br>
        information, see the <i>IBM Tivoli NetView for z/OS Data Model Reference.</i></li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b>Linking and Unlinking Using Method DUIFCLRT:</b> Method DUIFCLRT is used<br>
    to associate a real or aggregate object with an object of the<br>
    Display_Resource_Type_Class. For real objects, this can affect the priority<bR>
    aggregation value of the object if the default value from the<bR>
    Display_Resource_Type_Class object is being used. For aggregate objects, this can<br>
    affect any of the Degraded, SeverelyDegraded, or Unsatisfactory thresholds of the<br>
    object if the default value from the Display_Resource_Type_Class object is being<bR>
    used.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">For a real or aggregate object using any of these defaults, the effect is the same as<br>
    if the priority value or threshold field directly on the object had changed.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b>Changing the Status Mapping Table:</b> The status mapping table can be<br>
    dynamically updated using sample CNMSJH13. Because the definition of the XCPT<bR>
    group or any of the eight status groups can change, this sample optionally allows<bR>
    the DisplayStatus value of each real object in RODM to be updated (changed to the<bR>
    same value that it currently has) to trigger exception view and aggregation status<bR>
    recalculations.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b>Aggregation Methods</b><br>
    “GMFHS Methods” on page 496 provides a list of GMFHS methods. Each of the<bR>
    methods that are described, beginning with DUIFCLRT, contribute at least<bR>
    indirectly to aggregation. Three of these methods, DUIFCUAP, DUIFFAWS, and<bR>
    DUIFFRAS contribute directly to aggregation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Methods DUIFFAWS and DUIFFIRS are used to synchronize the aggregation<br>
    hierarchy if the UserStatus field of an object indicates that there is a threshold<bR>
    inconsistency, or any time that an operator decides that the status of aggregate<br>
    objects might be incorrect. DUIFFRAS performs a subset of the function performed<br>
    by DUIFFAWS. DUIFFRAS causes the status of each aggregate object to be<br>
    recalculated based on the existing XCPT group and status group counts for each<br>
    aggregate object. DUIFFAWS extends DUIFFRAS by accumulating all of the XCPT<br>
    group and status group counts for each aggregate object before recalculating the<br>
    status of the aggregate object.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 6%;">See “GMFHS Methods” on page 496 for a description of these methods.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 3%; font-size: 16px;"><b>Status Groups</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">The status (the value of the DisplayStatus field) of an aggregate object can be<br>
    customized based on the status of real object children under the aggregate.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">The sample table DUIFSMT described in “Defining Exception Criteria” on page 99<br>
    is used for this purpose. The STGRPn keywords (where n = 1 through 8) of the<bR>
    DUIFSMTE macro are used to map the status of real children objects to the desired<bR>
    status of the aggregate parent. For more information about the DUIFSMTE macro<bR>
    and how to refresh the DUIFSMT table, see “Customizing the DisplayStatus<br>
    Mapping Table for Exception Views” on page 102.</p><hr><hr>

<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">The STGRPn keywords are used to group DisplayStatus values in the same way<br>
    that the XCPT keyword is used for exception views. The groups are organized in a<bR>
    priority manner, with STGRP1 being the highest priority group and STGRP8 being<br>
    the lowest. The same status value can belong to more than one status group; in<br>
    effect, all status values can be placed in every status group. The DisplayStatus<br>
    value must also be an XCPT value for it to register as a STGRPn keyword.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">Status groups are used to map the status of a real object to the status of any parent<br>
    aggregate objects. If a real object changes to a status value that is in any of the<bR>
    status groups, then the corresponding status group for all parent aggregate objects<br>
    are used to determine the status value of the aggregate objects. If the real object<bR>
    status value is listed in more than one group, then the highest priority group that<br>
    contains the status value is used.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">The exception state of the real object is used to determine the status of any<br>
    aggregate parents under the following conditions:</p>
<ul class="c">
    <li>The real object has no status groups, or the status value of the real object is not<br>
        contained in any status group.</li>
    <li>The matching status group for the parent aggregate object is not defined.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 3%;  font-size: 16px;"><b>Using Status Groups</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">The following list contains additional operational characteristics of performing<br>
<ul class="c">
    <li>A status group match for an aggregate parent overrides the previous status of<br>
        that parent. The status group override remains in effect until <i>either:</i></li>
        1. A higher priority status group match occurs for the aggregate parent.<br>
        2. The status value of the last real object that is contributing to the current<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;highest priority status group for the aggregate parent no longer matches that<bR>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;status group, or the real object is unlinked from the hierarchy or is<bR>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suspended from aggregation.<bR>
    <li>A status group match overrides the status value of an aggregate parent at any<br>
        level of the aggregation hierarchy; there is no level limit as there is with<bR>
        aggregation priority values.</li>
    <li>As with exception based aggregation, suspended objects do not participate in<br>
        status group aggregation.</li>
    <li>The aggregate object threshold for the Unknown status of real objects is not<br>
        overridden by status group aggregation.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 3%;  font-size: 16px;"><b>Examples of Customizing Aggregate DisplayStatus</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">The following example is provided to give an understanding of using status<br>
    groups to customize the DisplayStatus value of an aggregate object. For the<bR>
    example, assume the following conditions:</p>
<ul class="c">
    <li>All objects of the T4NODE class contribute to exception state aggregation with a<br>
        DisplayStatus of unsatisfactory or unknown. If the DisplayStatus is<bR>
        unsatisfactory, it is tagged to status group 1.</li>
    <li>All objects of the 1.3.18.0.0.1821 class contribute to exception state aggregation<br>
        with a DisplayStatus of unsatisfactory, intermediate, or unknown. If the<bR>
        DisplayStatus is intermediate or unknown, it is tagged to status group 2.</li>
    <li>All aggregate objects have a status group match for status groups 1 and 2. An<br>
        object of the T4NODE class with an unsatisfactory status results in the status of<br>
        any aggregate parent to be DS136. An object of the 1.3.18.0.0.1821 class that has</li><hr><hr>



        either an unsatisfactory or an intermediate status results in the status of an<br>
        aggregate parent to be DS137, as long as this status is not overridden by a status<br>
        group 1 match.
    <li>Any object not in one of the three previously defined classes contributes to<br>
        exception state aggregation with a DisplayStatus of unsatisfactory or medium<br>
        unsatisfactory. If the DisplayStatus is UNSAT, it is tagged to status group 3.<bR>
        Because there is no matching status group 3 definition on any aggregate object, a<bR>
        real object DisplayStatus of UNSAT never causes a status group 3 override on an<br>
        aggregate parent.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Using the previously listed conditions, Figure 34 shows the coding of the<br>
    DisplayStatus mapping table. The fourth statement sets the defaults.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Using the Collection Definition Objects</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Collection definition objects are used by the GMFHS RODM Collection Manager<br>
    function to define the contents of Network_View_Class and<bR>
    GMFHS_Aggregate_Objects_Class objects. Collection definition objects are created<br>
    in either the Network_View_Collection_Class or the Aggregate_Collection_Class.<br>
    Each of these classes are subclasses of the Collection_Definition_Class. Objects<br>
    must not be created on the Collection_Definition_Class.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">The Network_View_Class and GMFHS_Aggregate_Objects_Class objects defined by<br>
    the collection definition objects are called collection creation objects. Collection<br>
    creation objects are created by the GMFHS RODM Collection Manager function<br>
    from the information in a collection definition object. The RODM Collection<br>
    Manager continuously watches for new collection definition objects to be created<br>
    or deleted in RODM. It creates a corresponding collection creation object<Br>
    dynamically. In addition, changes to the resource collection on an existing<br>
    collection definition object are monitored continuously. The changes are<Br>
    dynamically reflected to the corresponding collection creation object.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 3%; font-size: 16px;"><b>Collection Definition Objects</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Fields on a collection definition object specify the following information:</p>
<ul class="c">
    <li>The RODM MyName of the collection creation object.</li>
    <li>If a Network_View_Collection_Class object, the Annotation of the<br>
        Network_View_Class collection creation object.</li>
    <li>If an Aggregate_Collection_Class object, the DisplayResourceUserData of the<bR>
        GMFHS_Aggregate_Objects_Class collection creation object.</li>
    <li>If an Aggregate_Collection_Class object, the DisplayResourceName of the<br>
        GMFHS_Aggregate_Objects_Class collection creation object.</li>
    <li>If an Aggregate_Collection_Class object, the DisplayResourceType of the<br>
        GMFHS_Aggregate_Objects_Class collection creation object.</li>
    <li>If an Aggregate_Collection_Class object, the DisplayResourceOtherData of the<br>
        GMFHS_Aggregate_Objects_Class collection creation object.</li><hr><hr>


<li>If an Aggregate_Collection_Class object, the DegradedThreshold of the<br>
    GMFHS_Aggregate_Objects_Class collection creation object.</li>
<li>If an Aggregate_Collection_Class object, the SeverelyDegradedThreshold of the<br>
    GMFHS_Aggregate_Objects_Class collection creation object.</li>

<li>A data field that holds information that is interpreted by the NetView<br>
    management console.</li>
<li>A logic tree of rules that an object must pass to be included in the<br>
    Network_View_Class or GMFHS_Aggregate_Objects_Class collection creation<br>
    object.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; font-size: 16px;"><b>Collection Definition Object Fields</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">See the IBM Tivoli NetView for z/OS Data Model Reference for complete information<br>
    about the collection definition object classes and fields.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Most of the fields on the collection definition object are copied directly to the field<br>
    of the same name on the collection creation object. Some of the fields, such as the<bR>
    RequestFlags, CollectionLocateName, and WizardHints field, are used only by the<br>
    RODM Collection Manager. They are not used to supply a value to a field on the<br>
    collection creation object.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Some of the collection definition object fields are used to indirectly supply a value<br>
    to a field on the collection creation object. The LayoutType field, when specified on<br>
    an Aggregate_Collection_Class object, is converted to a character string and<br>
    appended to the string "RCMLayoutParmViewType". This concatenated string is<br>
    used as the name of a Layout_Parameters_For_View_Class object. This object is<br>
    then linked to the DetailViewLayoutForSelectedResource field of the collection<br>
    creation object.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">In a similar way, the DisplayResourceType field is used as the name of a<br>
    Display_Resource_Type_Class object. This object is then linked to the<br>
    DisplayResourceType field of the collection creation object. The CollectionSpecn<br>
    fields are used to populate the ContainsObjects field of a Network_View_Class<br>
    collection creation object and the AggregationChild and IsPartOf fields of a<br>
    GMFHS_Aggregate_Objects_Class collection creation object. See “Using Collection<br>
    Specifications” for more information about the usage of these fields.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">If the collection creation object already exists in RODM, it is deleted and recreated<br>
    using the information in the collection definition object. Name your collection<br>
    creation object objects carefully to ensure that they do not overwrite existing<br>
    Network_View_Class or GMFHS_Aggregate_Object_Class objects. Adding a prefix<br>
    or suffix to the collection creation object name that identifies it as an object that<br>
    was created by the RODM Collection Manager is an easy way to prevent creating a<br>
    duplicate collection creation object.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 3%; font-size: 16px;"><b>Using Collection Specifications</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">The collection specification is contained in the CollectionSpecn fields of the<br>
    collection definition object. These fields are concatenated together in ascending<br>
    numerical order of the n numeric portion of the field to create the full collection</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">specification. The first CollectionSpecn field must be CollectionSpec1. A collection<br>
    specification contains a set of rules that describe the objects to be in the<br>
    Network_View_Class collection creation object ContainsObjects field or the<br>
    GMFHS_Aggregate_Objects_Class AggregationChild and IsPartOf fields.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">The rules in the collection specification are applied dynamically. The rules match<br>
    objects that currently exist in RODM at the time the rules are initially processed by<br>
    the RODM Collection Manager function as well as objects that are dynamically<br>
    added to or deleted from RODM after the rules are initially processed. The RODM<br>Collection Manager places a RODM notification on all fields in all classes that are<br>
    specified in any collection specification for any collection definition object and is<bR>
    then notified when the value of these fields change for any object. As a result, the<br>
    RODM Collection Manager can update the objects in a collection creation object<bR>
    whenever a change occurs in RODM that affects the collection creation object.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; font-size: 16px;"><b>Conditional Statements</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Conditional statements are logically joined together and are a part of a collection<br>
    specification.. Each conditional statement is composed of a RODM field, a RODM<br>class, a value (or optionally), a set of values, and an operation. For each object<br>
    within the specified class, the specified field is compared to the value or<bR>
    list-of-values using the operation. If the operation compares successfully, then the<bR>
    object matches the condition. Otherwise, it fails the condition. The list of all objects<br>
    that compare successfully with the condition are the result of the conditional<br></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 6%;">statement. These objects are of RODM type ObjectList.<br>
    The simplest form of a collection specification is a single conditional statement,<br>
    and can be expressed in the following general terms:<br>
    <i>{Class/Field} operation {Value} ==> list_of_objects</i></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">For each object in the given Class, take the Field value of the object and compare it<br>
    to Value using the comparison operation. If the values compare successfully, place<br>
    the object in the output <i>list_of_objects.</i></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">The {Value} term can also be a reference to a set of values, much like the<br>
    {Class/Field} term indirectly references all objects on the Class. Each value is listed<br>
    directly in the collection specification. When more than one value is listed in the<br>
    {Value} term, the Field value of an object is compared against each value in the<br>
    value list. One or more of the values in the value list must compare successfully<br>
    for the object to be added to the <i>list_of_objects.</i></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">The single conditional statement can also be expressed in the following terms:<br>
<i>{Value1} operation {Value2} ==> list_of_objects</i></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Where both Value1 and Value2 can be either a single value or a value list. Value1<br>
    refers to the value of the Field on each object in the Class. Value2 refers to the list<bR>
    of values directly specified in the conditional statement. This generic syntax is<br>
    useful when complex conditional statements are described.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">In the case of the simple collection specification, the <i>list_of_objects</i> that results<br>
    becomes the object list for either the ContainsObjects field or the<br>
    AggregationChild/IsPartOf fields of the collection creation object. In effect, this<bR>
    <i>list_of_objects</i> is the final output from the collection specification</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; font-size: 16px;"><b>Postfix Notation in Conditional Statements</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">When a postfix notation is used to express the conditional statement, the statement
    is:</p><hr><hr>


<p style="padding-left: 6%; "><i>{Class/Field} {Value} operation ==> list_of_objects</i><br><bR>
    or<br>
    <i>{Value1} {Value2} operation ==> list_of_objects</i></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">Postfix notation is the notation used in the actual collection specification on the<br>
    collection definition object in RODM.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">For example, a simple collection specification is as follows:<br>
    <p style="font-size: 11px; padding-left: 6%;">|GMFHS_Managed_Real_Objects_Class|DisplayStatus|132|.EQ.</p></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">This collection specification takes the value of the DisplayStatus field for each<br>
    object in the GMFHS_Managed_Real_Objects_Class and compares it to 132. If the<bR>
    values are equal, the object is added to the <i>list_of_objects</i> that satisfy the conditional<br>
    statement. After all objects have been compared, the <i>list_of_objects</i> is put into the<br>
    object list field of the collection creation object.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">The conditional statement is also referred to as a leaf specification. A leaf<br>
    specification produces a <i>list_of_objects</i> from a comparison of two lists of values. It is<br>
    a leaf in the processing tree that a collection specification represents conceptually. It<br>
    is a leaf because its Value1 and Value2 operators are not produced by other<br>
    conditional statement evaluations from the collection specification, but instead<br>
    come directly from either the collection specification (Value2) or from a field on an<br>
    object (Value1).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; font-size: 16px; "><b>Complex Conditional Statements</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">Most collection specifications are not composed of only one conditional statement.<bR>
    For an object to be considered a candidate for a network view, for example, you<bR>
    can have its DisplayStatus be 132 AND its MyName be Chihuahua. In this case,<br>
    the conjunction AND is used to link the two conditional statements together:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">The syntax for linking conditional statements together in postfix notation is:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; font-size: 12px;">( {Class/Field} operation {Value} ) ( {Class/Field} operation<br>
    {Value} ) conjunction ==> <i>list_of_objects</i><br><br>
    or<br><bR>
    (leaf_specification) (leaf_specification) conjunction ==> <i>list_of_objects</i></p>

<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">Both leaf specifications produce an object list even if the list contains no objects;<br>
    the final <i>list_of_objects</i> is determined by applying the conjunction operator (AND or<bR>
    OR) to the two object lists. If the conjunction is AND, then the object identifier<bR>
    must be in both lists for it to be in the resulting <i>list_of_objects.</i> If the conjunction is<bR>
    OR, then the object identifier must be in one or the other list for it to be in the<bR>
    resulting <i>list_of_objects.</i></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">Since a leaf specification evaluates to a <i>list_of_objects,</i> the generic form of the<br>
    previous syntax is:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 6%; font-size: 12px;">(list_of_objects)(list_of_objects) conjunction ==> list_of_objects</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">This syntax is also referred to as a node specification. A node specification uses the<br>
    output from other conditional statements (object lists) as the operands of the<bR>
    conjunction. Since a node specification itself is a conditional statement that<br>
    produces an object list, an unlimited complex conditional can be built by<br>
    recursively substituting node specifications in the simple node specification as<bR>
    described here.</p><hr><hr>


<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">For example, consider the following complex conditional in postfix notation:<br>
    (a) (b) EQ (c) (d) EQ AND (e) (f) EQ (g) (h) EQ AND OR<bR><br>
    To continue this example, we build it up to the generic form of a complex<bR>
    conditional. First, (a) (b) EQ is a leaf specification:<bR>
    (leaf_specification) (c) (d) EQ AND (e) (f) EQ (g) (h) EQ AND OR<bR><br>
    Next, (c) (d) EQ is also a leaf specification:<br>
    (leaf_specification) (leaf_specification) AND (e) (f) EQ (g) (h) EQ AND OR<bR><br>
    or<bR>
    (list_of_objects) (list_of_objects) AND (e) (f) EQ (g) (h) EQ AND OR<br><br>
    Next, (list_of_objects) (list_of_objects) AND is in the form of a node specification:<br>
    (node_specification) (e) (f) EQ (g) (h) EQ AND OR<bR><br>
    or<bR>
    (list_of_objects) (e) (f) EQ (g) (h) EQ AND OR<br><br>
    Next, (e) (f) EQ (g) (h) EQ is identical to (a) (b) EQ (c) (d) EQ:<bR>
    (list_of_objects) (leaf_specification) (leaf_specification) AND OR<bR><br>
    Evaluating the complex conditional that involves the leaf specifications, we have:<br>
    (list_of_objects) (node_specification) OR<bR><br>
    or<bR>
    (list_of_objects) (list_of_objects) OR<br><br>
    This final conditional matches the generic syntax described here, and produces the<br>
    final object list for the complex conditional. See “Stack Model Postfix Processing”<bR>
    for more information about the method used to actually evaluate the postfix<br>
    notation used in a collection specification.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; font-size: 16px;"><b>Stack Model Postfix Processing</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">A collection specification is processed by using a virtual stack to hold the<br>
    intermediate results from the conditional statements in the collection specification.<br>
    Any output from a leaf specification, which is an object list, is added to the stack.<bR>
    When a conjunction is encountered in the collection specification, the last two<bR>
    object lists added to the stack are removed from the stack, the conjunction is<br>
    applied to the object lists, and the resulting object list is added to the stack. This<br>
    processing continues, left to right, to the end of the collection specification. At the<bR>
    end of the collection specification, there sh be one and only one object list left on<br>
    the stack. If this is not the case, the collection specification is syntactically incorrect.<br>
    The object list left on the stack is the final result of the collection specification. It is<br>
    assigned directly to the ContainsObjects or AggregationChild/IsPartOf fields of the<br>
    collection creation object.<br><br>
    Although leaf specifications are processed using the postfix notation, the input to<br>
    the operator (Value1 and Value2) are not object lists. The stack only contains object<bR>
    lists. Therefore, leaf specifications are evaluated without using the stack. Their<br>
    output, which is a list of objects, is added to the stack.<br><br>
    The following example shows the stack operations that occur while evaluating the<br>
    example of a complex conditional in postfix notation that is described in “Complex<br>
    Conditional Statements” on page 145:</p><hr><hr>



<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">(a) (b) EQ (c) (d) EQ AND (e) (f) EQ (g) (h) EQ AND OR<br><br>
    Initially, the stack is empty. Reading the collection specification from left to right,<br>
    the leaf specification (a) (b) EQ is evaluated to the object list <i>a_b_objects</i> and added<bR>
    to the stack. The result is:<br>
<table border="1" width="40%" height="50px">
    <th>Stack contains:</th><th><i>a_b_objects</i></th>
    <tr><td>Remaining specification:</td><td>(c) (d) EQ AND (e) (f) EQ (g) (h) EQ AND OR</td></tr>
</table><br>
Since (c) is not a conjunction, what follows must be another leaf specification;<bR>
anything other than a conjunction or a valid leaf specification is syntactically<bR>
incorrect. (c) (d) EQ is evaluated to the object list c_d_objects and added to the<br>
stack. The result is:<br>
<table border="1" width="40%" height="50px">
    <th>Stack contains:</th><th><i>c_d_objects<br>a_b_objects</i></th>
    <tr><td>Remaining specification:</td><td>AND (e) (f) EQ (g) (h) EQ AND OR</td></tr>
</table><br>
AND is a conjunction, so the first two object lists on the stack (in this case, the<br>
only two), are removed, then evaluated using the conjunction, and the result is<bR>
added to the stack. It is an error if the stack does not contain two or more object<br>
lists when a conjunction is evaluated. The result is:<br>
<table border="1" width="40%" height="50px">
    <th>Stack contains:</th><th><i>a_b_AND_ c_d_objects</i></th>
    <tr><td>Remaining specification:</td><td>(e) (f) EQ (g) (h) EQ AND OR</td></tr>
</table><br>
Because (e) is not a conjunction, what follows is another leaf specification. (e) (f)<br>
EQ is evaluated to the object list e_f_objects and is added to the stack. The result<bR>
is:<br>
<table border="1" width="40%" height="50px">
    <th>Stack contains: </th><th><i>e_f_objects<br>a_b_AND_ c_d_objects</i></th>
    <tr><td>Remaining specifications:</td><td>(g) (h) EQ AND OR</td></tr>
    </table><br>
    Because (g) is not a conjunction, what follows is another leaf specification. (g) (h)<br>
    EQ is evaluated to the object list g_h_objects and is added to the stack. The result<bR>
    is:<br>
<table border="1" width="40%" height="50px">
    <th>Stack contains:</th><th><i>g_h_objects<br>e_f_objects<br>a_b_AND_c_d_objects</i></th>
  <tr><td>Remaining specifications</td><td>AND OR</td></tr>
</table><br>
AND is a conjunction, so the first two object lists on the stack are removed,<br>
evaluated using the conjunction, and the result is added to the stack. The result is:<br>
<table border="1" width="40%" height="50px">
    <th>Stack contains:</th><th><i>e_f_AND_g_h_objects<br>a_b_objects AND c_d_objects</i></th>
    <tr><td>Remaining specifications:</td><td>OR</td></tr>
</table><hr><hr></p>

<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">Finally, OR is a conjunction, so the last two object lists on the stack are removed,<br>
evaluated using the conjunction, and the result is added to the stack. The result is:<br>

    <th>Stack contains: </th><th><i>a_b_AND c_d_objects_OR_e_f_AND_g_h_objects)</i></th>

</table><br>
At this point, there sh be only one object list on the stack (there is) and nothing left<br>
in the collection specification. If either of these is not true, the collection<br>
specification was syntactically incorrect. The final object list is the result of the<br>
collection specification, and is copied to the collection creation object.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; font-size: 16px;" ><b>Collection Specification Syntax</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">The syntax for the collection specification field is:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">The character that separates the individual tokens in the collection specification is<bR>
    defined as a part of the collection specification. <separator> can be any character.<br> This character is allowed to be user defined because any selected value can<bR>
    possibly be included in a <class-name>, <field_name>, or <value>. In the NetView<bR>management console interface, the vertical bar ( | ) is used as the default separator<br>
    character.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; font-size: 16px; "><b>Collection Specification Values</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">The {Value} portion of a leaf specification can be thought of as a pattern. A pattern<br>
    is a sequence of characters, some of which have special meanings, that is matched<bR>
    against a specific value or set of values. The special characters allow a pattern to<br>
    describe more than one value. A pattern with no special characters describes only<bR>
    one value, the value that is composed of exactly the characters in the pattern. A<br>
    pattern with special characters is similar to a list of values, where the list of values<br>
    is composed of all of the unique values that match the pattern. If {Value} is a list of<br>
    values, each of the values within the list can be a pattern with special characters.<br><bR>
    These patterns can be expressed using DOS wildcards or regular expressions. A<br>
    regular expression is a set of characters and operators that define a string or group<br>
    of strings in a search pattern. Regular expressions also contain metacharacters,<br>
    which are characters with special meanings. The default notation for patterns is to<bR>
    use DOS wildcards. If the pattern uses regular expressions, the first character of<br>
    the pattern must be the backslash (\). If the pattern does not use any of the special<bR>
    characters (in either DOS or regular expression notation), the pattern resolves to<bR>
    single unique value for the comparison operation.<br><bR>
        If you want to use DOS wildcards and the first character of the DOS wildcard is a<br>
        backslash (\), then you must escape it with a plus sign (+). That is, +\value is<bR>
        interpreted as a DOS wildcard value of \value. Also, if you want to use a DOS<bR>
        wildcard and the first character of the DOS wildcard is a plus sign, then you must<bR>
        escape that with another plus sign. Again, ++value is interpreted as a DOS<bR>
        wildcarded value of +value. The plus sign as an escape character is effective only<bR>
        as the first character of the value, and only when followed by another plus sign or<bR>
        backslash.<br><br>
        The special characters for DOS patterns are an asterisk (*) and the question mark<br>
        (?). An asterisk matches zero or more characters from where the asterisk is in the<bR>
        pattern. A question mark matches any one character in the pattern. Special<br>
        characters for DOS patterns can be used anywhere in a pattern. The pattern<br>
        *re?*om* matches any string that has an re that is preceded by zero or more other<bR>
        characters, at least one character after the re, then zero or more characters until om,<bR> followed by zero or more characters to the end of the string.<br><bR>
            A pattern using DOS wildcard characters must always match the entire string that<br>
            it is being compared with. In this example, if the pattern was re?*om without the<bR>
            preceding and ending asterisks, then the matched string must begin with re and<bR>
            end with om. This is slightly different from the way regular expressions work.<br><bR><hr><hr></p>
            
<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">Regular expressions are used for more complex pattern matching. DOS patterns in<br>
                a collection specification are converted to regular expressions by the RODM<bR>
                Collection Manager prior to matching the pattern against a value; all pattern<bR>
                matching is done by the RODM Collection Manager using regular expressions. The<br>
                regular expression pattern is applied to the substrings of the input string; if it<bR>
                matches a substring, then the pattern is considered to have matched the entire<br>
                input string. Because regular expressions match on a substring of the input string,<bR>
                the caret (^) metacharacter is added to the beginning of any converted DOS<br>
                wildcard pattern, and the dollar sign ($) metacharacter is added to the end of the<bR>
                same converted DOS wildcard pattern in order to enforce the DOS wildcard<br>
                constraint of matching the entire string.<br><br>
                The simplest form of regular expression is a string of characters with no special<br>
                meaning. The following characters have special meaning; they are used to form<bR>
                extended regular expressions:<br><br>
                <b>. (period)</b><br></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 10%;">The period symbol matches any one character except the terminal new-line<bR>
                character.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; "><b>[string]</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 10%;">A string within square brackets specifies any of the characters in the string.<br>
    Thus [abc], if compared to other strings, matches any that contains a, b, or<br>
    c. If the string within the square brackets contains a character, followed by<br>
    a hyphen, followed by another character, it indicates that all of the<br>
    characters in the current collating sequence between the two intervening<br>
    characters are considered a part of the string. For example, [a-z] can be<br>
    equivalent to [abc...xyz] or, with a different collating sequence, it can be<br>
    equivalent to [aAbBcC...xXyYzZ]. If the string within the square brackets<br>
    begins with the caret (^) symbol, it negates the characters within the<br>
    square brackets. Thus [^abc], if compared to other strings, fails to match<br>
    any that contains even one a, b, or c.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; "><b>expression[m] or expression[m,] or expression[m,u]</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 10%;">Integer values enclosed in [ ] indicate the number of times to apply the<br>
    preceding regular expression. The value for m is the minimum number,<br> and u is the maximum number. The value for u must be less than 256. If<br>
    you specify m, it indicates the exact number of times to apply the regular<br>
    expression. [m,] is equivalent to [m,u], where u is an unbounded upper<br>
    limit. They both match m or more occurrences of the expression. The plus<br>
    sign (+) and asterisk (*) operations are equivalent to [1,] and [0,]<br>
    respectively.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; "><b>expression* (asterisk)</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 10%;">The asterisk symbol indicates zero or more of any characters. For example,<br>
    a*e is equivalent to any of the following strings: 99ae9, aaaaae, a999e99.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; "><b>$ (dollar symbol)</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 10%;">The dollar symbol matches the end of the string.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; "><b>^ (caret)</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 10%;">The caret symbol matches the beginning of the string.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; "><b>\ (backslash)</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 10%;">The backslash character turns off the special meaning of any character<bR>
    following the backslash, thereby forcing the character to be intepreted as<br>
    itself in the pattern. For example, \. matches the . character, not a \<br>
    followed by any character.</p><hr><hr>


<p style="padding-left: 6%; "><b>expression+ (plus)</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 10%;">The plus sign specifies one or more occurrences of a character. Thus,<br>
    smith+ern is equivalent to, for example, smithhhern.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; "><b>(expression)</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 10%;">Groups a subexpression allowing an operator, such as *, +, or [ ], to work<bR>
    on the subexpression enclosed in parentheses. For example, (a*(cb+)*)<bR>
    matches any string that contained zero or more occurrences of a, followed<br>
    by zero or more occurrences of the pattern c followed by one or more<br>
    occurrences of b.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">The asterisk (*) character in a DOS pattern becomes a period asterisk (.*) in a<bR>
    regular expression. The question mark (?) characters in a DOS pattern becomes a<bR>
    period (.) in a regular expression.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">All DOS patterns are prepended with a caret (^) (which matches the beginning of a<br>
    string), and appended with a dollar sign ($) (which matches the end of a string)<bR>
    when they are converted into a regular expression by the RODM Collection<br>
    Manager. This forces the entire string to be matched, character for character.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">For example, the pattern *IS?R* is a DOS pattern that matches the following<br>
    strings:</p>
<ul class="c">
    <li>BISTRO</li>
    <li>MISERLY</li>
    <li>MISER</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">However, it does not match these strings:</p>
<ul class="c">
 <li>MISTER</li>
 <li>DISRUPT</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">The same pattern expressed as a regular expression is \.*IS.R.*</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">The pattern \RE[AGLRU]+.E[^A-O]+.*ON is a regular expression that matches the<br>
    following strings:</p>
 <ul class="c">
 <li>REGULAR EXPRESSION</li>
 <li>REGAL-EXPATRIATION</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">However, it does not match these strings:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 6%; font-size: 16px;"><b>Values and Data Types</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; ">A {Value} in a leaf specification is always initially interpreted as a character string.<br>
    The {Class/Field} that the {Value} is compared with can be one of a number of<br>
    actual data types. If necessary, {Value} (each value, in the case of a list of values) is<br>
    converted to the appropriate data type before the comparison is done. In general,<Br>
    only character data types can be expressed using DOS wildcards or regular<br>

<p style="padding-left: 3%;"><b>Examples of Collection Definition Objects</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">This section contains examples of the Collection Definition Objects.<br>
    <b>Example 1:</b><br>
    Collect all objects in the GMFHS_Managed_Real_Objects_Class whose<br>
    DisplayStatus field is not equal to 129 and show them in a Network View. The<br>
    vertical bar character (|) serves as the separator character on the CollectionSpec1<br>
    field.<br>
    The CDO object that describes this collection can be specified as follows in a<br>
    RODM loader file:<br>
    <img style="padding-left: 5%;" src="C:\Users\my pc\OneDrive\Desktop\html1/(101-200)pc22.jpg"><br>
    This RODM Collection Manager creates a Network_View_Class object called<br>
    "Example1" with a LayoutType of 1 and Annotation of "Example1 Annotation". The<br>
    collection specification represents a single conditional (it is composed of a single<br>
    leaf specification). The matching object list is copied to the ContainsObject field of<br>
    the Example1 view.<br>
    <b>Example 2:</b><br>
    Collect all objects in the appnTransmissionGroupCircuit class (actual class name is<br>
    1.3.18.0.0.2058) whose DisplayResourceOtherData field contains a CP as the first<br>
    two characters, and Active as the last six characters AND all objects in the<br>
    appnTransmissionGroupCircuit class whose AggregationPriorityValue is equal to 1,<br>
    2, or 3 , and put them into an Aggregate. The vertical bar character (|) serves as<br>
    the separator character.<br>
    The CDO object that describes this collection can be specified as follows in a<br>
    RODM loader file:<br>
<img style="padding-left: 5%;" src="C:\Users\my pc\OneDrive\Desktop\html1/(101-200)pc23.jpg"><br>
The RODM Collection Manager creates a GMFHS_Aggregate_Objects_Class object<br>
called Example2 with a DisplayResourceOtherData of "Example2 Other Data" and<br>
a DisplayResourceUserData of "Example2 User Data". The other fields that are not<br>
specified on the Aggregate_Collection_Class object are set to the defaults used for<br>
objects created on the GMFHS_Aggregate_Objects_Class.<br><hr><hr></p>


<p style="padding-left: 6%;">The collection specification is represented in both of the CollectionSpecn fields. It<br>
can be placed entirely in either the CollectionSpec1 or CollectionSpec2 field; this<br>
example demonstrates the concatenation of the two fields. The actual collection,<br>
specification, after concatenation, is:<br></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%; font-size: 12px;">|1.3.18.0.0.2058|DisplayResourceOtherData|CP*Active|.CONTAINS=.|1.3.18.0.0.2058|<br>
    AggregationPriorityValue|1|2|3|.EQ.|.AND.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 6%;">This collection specification represents a complex conditional (it is composed of a<br>
    two leaf specifications). DOS wildcards are used to find the objects that match the<br>
    DisplayResourceOtherData value. If there are three objects in class 1.3.18.0.0.2058<br>
    with objects IDs 1, 2, and 3, and their corresponding DisplayResourceOtherData<br>
    fields contain:<br>
<ul class="c">
    <li>CPCP-supportedActive</li>
    <li>CP-CP Session Support</li>
    <li>CPCP-supportedNotActive</li>
</ul>

<p style="padding-left: 6%;">and their corresponding AggregationPriorityValue fields contain:</p>
    <ul class="c">
    <li>-1</li>
    <li>2</li>
    <li>3</li>
</ul>
   <p style="padding-left: 6%;">After evaluating the first leaf specification, the virtual stack contains:</p>

<ul class="c">
    <li>{1, 3}</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">where {1, 3} is the object list produced from evaluating the leaf specification. After<bR>
    evaluating the second leaf specification, the virtual stack contains:</p>
<ul class="c">
    <li>{2, 3}</li>
    <li>{1, 3}</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">The .AND. conjunction causes the two object lists to be removed from the stack;<br>
    their intersection results in the list {3} which is added to the stack. This object is<bR>
    the result of the entire complex conditional. It is linked into both the<br>
    AggregationChild field (using the DUIFCUAP method) and the IsPartOf field on<br>
    the Example2 object.<br><br>
There is no benefit using two different classes in the individual leaf specifications.<bR>
    Both leaf specifications, by definition, produce object lists that contain no objects in<bR>
    common. The intersection of the lists requested by the .AND. conjunction therefore<br>
    always produces an empty object list. If the conjunction is .OR., then using two<br>
    different classes is acceptable.<bR><br>
        Example 3:<bR><br>
            Collect all objects in the GMFHS_Managed_Real_Objects class whose MyName<br>
matches TEST plus an alphabetic classification character plus some number of<br>
additional characters plus 1 plus a numeric range character; for example,<br>
"TESTACPU10", as long as the alphabetic classification character is not B, and<br>
whose DisplayStatus is either Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory. Add to this list the<br>
objects in the GMFHS_Aggregate_Objects_Class whose MyName matches TEST<br>
plus an alphabetic classification character plus some number of additional<Br>
characters, for example, "TESTACPUALL", as long as the alphabetic classification<br>
character is not B. Enter them into a Network View.<br><bR>
The CDO object that describes this collection can be specified as follows in a<br>
RODM loader file:</p><hr><hr>

</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">The expression for the first leaf specification is given in regular expression<br>
    notation. DOS wildcards do not have a way to specify that the 5th character must<bR>
    be between A and C, so the regular expression was used in this case. After<br>
    evaluating the first leaf specification, the virtual stack contains:<bR>
    {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
    </p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">After evaluating the second leaf specification, the virtual stack contains:<bR>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}<br>
    The .AND. conjunction removes these two lists from the stack, and replaces them<br>
with:<bR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;{1, 2, 5, 6, 7}<br><br>
After evaluating the third leaf specification, the virtual stack contains:
    </p><hr><hr>


<p style="padding-left: 6%;">{2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9}<br>
    {1, 2, 5, 6, 7}<br><bR>
        The .AND. conjunction removes these two lists from the stack, and replaces them<br>with:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;{2, 5, 7}<br><br>
        After evaluating the fourth leaf specification, the virtual stack contains:<bR>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;{10, 11, 12}<bR>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;{2, 5, 7}<br><bR>
After evaluating the fifth (and final) leaf specification, the virtual stack contains:<bR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;{10, 12, 13}<bR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;{10, 11, 12}<bR>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;{2, 5, 7}<br><bR>
                The .AND. conjunction removes the top two lists from the stack, and replaces them<br>
                with:<bR>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;{10, 12}<bR>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;{2, 5, 7}<bR><br>
                            Finally, the .OR. conjunction removes only two lists from the stack, and replaces<br>
                            them with:<bR>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;{2, 5, 7, 10, 12}<br>  <br>  
                                This becomes the final object list returned by the complex conditional which is<br>
                                then linked in to the ContainsObjects field of the Example 3 object.

<p style="padding-left: 6%;">This section describes NetView Resource Manager views and how they can be<br>
    customized. You can use NetView Resource Manager to graphically monitor and<bR>
    manage NetView tasks for resource utilization and status with the NetView<br>
    management console. You can monitor all the NetView programs in your<bR>
    enterprise using one NetView management console. For more information about<bR>
    setting up and using NetView Resource Manager see the following books:</p>

<ul class="c">

<p style="padding-left: 3%; font-size: 16px;"><b>NetView Resource Manager Views</b></p>

<p style="padding-left: 6%;">When NetView Resource Manager is active, NetViewTasks is displayed in the<br>
    NetView management console view tree. This opens a view of the NetView<br>
    Resource Manager domain aggregate objects. You can navigate from this view to<br>
    the NRM Task aggregate objects view. From a Task aggregate, you can navigate to<br>
    a view with the following real objects, which represent statistical monitors:</p>
<ul class="c">
    <li>Status</li>
    <li>CPU (CPU utilization)</li>
    <li>STG (Storage)</li>

<p style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Chapter 6. Customizing GMFHS to Process and Receive<br>
    Alerts and Resolutions</b></p>

<p style="padding-left: 6%;">This chapter describes how GMFHS receives and processes alerts and resolutions.<br>
    It describes how the customization changes you make affect this processing. Ensure<bR>
    the name of the objects you create in RODM match the resource names supplied<bR>
    by alerts.</p>
<hr style="height: 1px; color: black; background-color: black;">
<p style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Receiving and Monitoring Alerts or Resolutions</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">GMFHS monitors the status of non-SNA resources and the alert-received (event<br>
    notification) user status of SNA resources by receiving copies of all alert and<br>
    resolution major vectors that the hardware monitor automates. GMFHS identifies<br>
    the resources on which these major vectors report. GMFHS relates each status<bR>
    report to the object in RODM that represents the resource.<br><br>
    <b>Note:</b> A non-SNA domain in GMFHS is any valid combination of a service point,<br>
    transaction program, and element management system. A non-SNA domain in<br>
    GMFHS functions as the interface between the NetView program and the non-SNAnetwork.<br><br>
There are seven elements involved in this process; customization can affect all of<br>
    them:</p>
    <ul class="c">
        <li>What GMFHS receives from the hardware monitor</li>
        <li>Objects in RODM representing SNA resources</li>
        <li>Objects in RODM representing network management gateways (NMGs)</li>
        <li>Objects in RODM representing non-SNA domains</li>
        <li>Objects in RODM representing non-SNA resources</li>
        <li>DUIFEDEF alert processing</li>
        <li>Alert translation tables</li>
    </ul>
<p style="padding-left: 3%;"><b>What GMFHS Receives from the Hardware Monitor</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">When NetView receives an alert, the alert is passed through the automation table<bR>
    where the DUIFECMV command processor is run. This command processor sends<bR>
    information to GMFHS and initiates GMFHS processing of the alert. The<br>
    information received by GMFHS is:</p>
<ul class="c">
    <li>A copy of the major vector.</li>
    <li>The hardware monitor resource hierarchy created from the content of the<br>
        hierarchy and resource list (H/RL) subvector or hierarchy name list (HNL)<br>
        subvector</li>
    <li>The name of the SNA domain from which the major vector originated.</li>
    <li>An optional set of parameters to DUIFECMV which bypass the DUIFEDEF alert<br>
        processor. The parameters are CLASS, DOMAIN, INDICAT, OBJNAME,<br>
        STATUS, and GMFHSDOM. If specified, the following parameters are required:</li>
        – DOMAIN<br>
        – CLASS<br>
        – OBJNAME<br>
        – INDICAT
</ul><hr><hr>

<p style="padding-left: 8%;">STATUS is required only if the value of parameter INDICAT is 2 or 4.<br>
    GMFHSDOM is optional.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">GMFHS checks the hardware monitor resource hierarchy rather than the H/RL or<br>
    HNL subvectors for resource names. Some of its logic depends on the presence or<br>
    absence of these two subvectors.<br><br>
    If parameters are specified for DUIFECMV, they cause GMFHS to bypass the<br>
    processing described in “Objects in RODM Representing SNA Resources,” “Objects<br>
    in RODM Representing NMGs” on page 167, “Objects in RODM Representing<br>
    Non-SNA Domains” on page 167, and “Objects in RODM Representing Non-SNA<Br>
    Resources” on page 169. CLASS, DOMAIN, and OBJNAME are used to identify<br>
    the object to which the alert is logged, and STATUS specifies a value for the new<bR>
    resource status. INDICAT specifies the type of status processing to perform. When<Br>
    a value of 1 or 3 is specified for INDICAT, the procedure described in “Alert.<br>
    Translation Tables” on page 174 is used.<br><br>
    <b>Note:</b> Command processor DUIFECMV must run under the autotask DUIFEAUT.<bR> Refer to the NetView online help or the <i>IBM Tivoli NetView for z/OS Command<bR>
    Reference Volume</i> 1 (A-N) for more information about DUIFECMV and its operands.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 3%;"><b>Objects in RODM Representing SNA Resources</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">When GMFHS receives an alert or resolution major vector, it tries to determine<br>
    whether the reported resource is an SNA resource or a non-SNA resource. If the<br>
    major vector contains neither the H/RL subvector nor the HNL subvector, GMFHS<br>
    handles the major vector as an SNA resource. If either of these subvectors is<bR>
    present and the hardware monitor resource hierarchy contains either a service<bR>
    point resource type (SP or PUGW), or a transaction program resource type (TP or<bR>
    PUGA), the resource must be a non-SNA resource. GMFHS uses the “First<bR>
    Method” on page 167 to process this non-SNA resource. If either of these<bR>
    subvectors is present and neither a service point type (SP or PUGW), or a<bR>
    transaction program resource type (TP or PUGA) is contained in the hardware<BR>
    monitor hierarchy, the resource being reported on can still be either a SNA or a<bR>
    non-SNA resource. GMFHS uses the method described in “Second Method” on<bR>
    page 168.<br><bR>
        If GMFHS determines that the resource being reported on is a non-SNA resource,<br>
        GMFHS takes action according to procedures described in “Objects in RODM<bR>
        Representing Non-SNA Resources” on page 169. The remainder of this section<bR>
        describes the actions GMFHS takes if it determines that the resource being<bR>
        reported on is an SNA resource.<br><br>
        GMFHS tries to find an object in the SNA_Domain_Class with a name that<br>
        matches the original SNA domain name for the major vector. If it does not find this<bR>
        object, GMFHS drops the major vector. If this object is found, GMFHS tries to find<bR>
        an object in the GMFHS_Shadow_Objects_Class with a name that is the<bR>
        concatenation of the SNA network (SNANet) field of the SNA_Domain_Class<bR>
        object, a period (.) delimiter, and the resource name farthest to the right in the<bR>
        hardware monitor resource hierarchy.<br><bR>
            For example, suppose the following object is defined in the SNA_Domain_Class:</p>
<img style="padding-left: 5%;" src="C:\Users\my pc\OneDrive\Desktop\html1/(101-200)pc30.jpg"><hr><hr>


<p style="padding-left: 6%;">If GMFHS receives an alert with an origin SNA domain name of A10NV and that<br>
    alert has NT69I073 as the name farthest to the right in the hardware monitor<bR>
    resource hierarchy, the name of the object searched for in the<br>
    GMFHS_Shadow_Objects_Class follows:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 8%; font-size: 10px;">NETA.NT69I073</p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">If GMFHS finds this object in the GMFHS_Shadow_Objects_Class, it turns on the<br>
    event notification bit in the UserStatus field of this object, creates an event report<bR>
    protocol data unit, and logs it.<br><br>
    When you create objects in the SNA_Domain_Class and<br>
    GMFHS_Shadow_Objects_Class, you need to coordinate the names of these objects<bR>
    with the names of your SNA networks, SNA domains, and SNA resources in those<bR>
    domains.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 3%; font-size: 16px;"><b>Objects in RODM Representing NMGs</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">GMFHS uses NMG objects during alert processing if it has determined that the<br>
    second method is necessary to resolve the alert. The way in which the NMG object<br>
    is used is defined under the “Second Method” on page 168.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 3%; font-size: 16px;"><b>Objects in RODM Representing Non-SNA Domains</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">When GMFHS receives an alert or resolution for a non-SNA resource, it first<bR>
    determines the identity of the non-SNA domain containing the non-SNA resource<br>
    being reported on. Next GMFHS tries to identify the resource itself. GMFHS does<br>
    this by using hardware monitor resource hierarchy information as a search<bR>
    argument to compare against the names of objects you defined in the<bR>
    Non_SNA_Domain_Class. Knowing how this search is accomplished can help you<bR>
    understand how to set up a plan to name your Non_SNA_Domain_Class objects<br>
    with information contained in the hardware monitor resource hierarchy.<br><br>
    GMFHS uses two methods mentioned previously to determine the identity of the<br>
    non-SNA domain. These methods are described in detail in this chapter. In the first<bR>
    method, the resource is assumed to be a non-SNA resource. If, after applying this<bR>
    method, GMFHS cannot identify the non-SNA domain of the resource being<bR>
    reported on, it drops the major vector because it cannot identify the non-SNA<bR>
    resource. In the second method, alerts that are not for non-SNA resources are<br>
    assumed to be for SNA resources, and the steps described in “Objects in RODM<br>Representing SNA Resources” on page 166 are used. When you define objects in<bR>
    the Non_SNA_Domain_Class, be sure your plan includes information GMFHS<bR>
    looks for in the hardware monitor resource hierarchy.<br><bR>
        <b>First Method</b><bR>
        As described previously, it has been determined that either a Hierarchy Resource<br>
        List or a Hierarchy Name List subvector is present in the alert, and the alert<bR>
        contains a service point or a transaction program or both upon entrance to this<bR>
        method.<br><bR>
            Beginning with the hierarchy element defined as a service point (if found), or<bR>
            beginning with the hierarchy element defined as a transaction program if a service<bR>
            point is not found, GMFHS builds a concatenation of all names remaining in the<br>
            resource hierarchy. In this concatenation, the names are separated from one another<bR>
            by a period (.).<br><br>
            GMFHS next compares this concatenation with the names of all objects in the<bR>
            Non_SNA_Domain_Class. All of the objects in this class have been sorted in<br><bR>
            
            
                descending order based on the length of their names. If GMFHS cannot find a<br>
                non-SNA domain object that matches the current concatenation list, then the<bR>
                rightmost object is removed from concatenation and the Non_SNA_Domain_Class<BR>
                is searched once again for this new name. This process continues until either a<bR>
                Non_SNA_Domain_Class object matches, or the concatenation list contains no<bR>
                more elements.<bR><bR>
                    For example, suppose the hardware monitor resource hierarchy contains the<bR>
                    following resource name and type pairs:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 9%;"><table >
    <th>Name</th><th>Type</th>
    <tr><td>NMGPU5</td><td>PU</td></tr>
    <tr><td>SP010</td><td>SP</td></tr>
    <tr><td>RING010</td></tr>
    <tr><td>PRINTER1</td><td>PRTR</td></tr>
</table></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">There is an object in the Non_SNA_Domain_Class named SP010.RING010. GMFHS<br>
    looks for a Non_SNA_Domain_Class object with one of these names, exactly as<bR>
    shown, and in the order shown:</p>
<img style="padding-left: 5%;" src="C:\Users\my pc\OneDrive\Desktop\html1/(101-200)pc31.jpg">
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">GMFHS acts on the first object that matches with the current concatenation list. In<br>
    this example, there is no non-SNA domain object named SP010.RING010.PRINTER1,<br> but there is an object named SP010.RING010. GMFHS handles the object named<br>
    SP010.RING010 as though it represents the domain of the resource reported on.<br><br>
    There might also be a non-SNA domain object named SP010 in this example.<br>
    However, the match will occur on the first non-SNA domain object in the sorted<br>
    list; therefore, the match will occur on SP010.RING010 before SP010. Also, the names<br>
    must match exactly; a concatenation name of SP010.RING01 will not match a<bR>
    non-SNA domain name of SP010.RING010.<br><br>
    <b>Second Method</b><br>
    If the alert hierarchy does not have a service point or a transaction program,<br>
    GMFHS compares each name in the resource hierarchy, beginning with the<bR>
    rightmost resource in the hierarchy, to each NMG_Class object name.<br><br>
    <b>Note:</b> This is not a concatenation list as used in the first method, but rather each<br>
    individual resource name. If a match is not found, the alert is treated as an alert<br>
    for a SNA object.<br><br>
    If a match is found, all Non_SNA_Domain_Class objects are searched for a match<br>
    on the same name. If a match is not found, the alert is treated as an alert for a<br>
    SNA object. Otherwise, a match has been found on a non-SNA domain object.<br><br>
    For example, suppose the hardware monitor resource hierarchy contains the<bR>
    following resource name and type pairs:</p>
<img style="padding-left: 8%;" src="C:\Users\my pc\OneDrive\Desktop\html1/(101-200)pc32.jpg">
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">There is an object in the NMG_Class named NMGPU5, and an object in the<br>
    Non_SNA_Domain_Class named NMGPU5. GMFHS looks for an NMG_Class object<bR>
    with one of these names, exactly as shown, and in the order shown:</p>

<img style="padding-left: 8%;" src="C:\Users\my pc\OneDrive\Desktop\html1/(101-200)pc33.jpg">

<p style="padding-left: 6%;">As soon as a match is found with an NMG_Class object (in this case, with the<br>
    object named NMGPU5), a check is made for the same object name in the<bR>
    Non_SNA_Domain_Class. If a match is found there, then this domain contains the<bR>
    object being reported on.<br><bR>
        It is important to note that if the Non_SNA_Domain_Class name does not match,<bR>
        the search will not continue with the next name in the resource list and the<bR>
        NMG_Class. The first time the NMG_Class is matched, either the<br>
        Non_SNA_Domain name also matches the resource hierarchy element, or the alert<bR>
        is treated as a SNA resource alert.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 3%; font-size: 16px;"><b>Objects in RODM Representing Non-SNA Resources</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">If GMFHS finds the non-SNA domain as described in “Objects in RODM<br>
    Representing Non-SNA Domains” on page 167, it tries to identify the non-SNA<br>
    resource. GMFHS does this by invoking the load module named in the AlertProc<br>
    field of the Non_SNA_Domain_Class object. Refer to the <i>IBM Tivoli NetView for<br>
    z/OS Data Model Reference</i> for more information about the AlertProc field.<br><br>
    The default value for the AlertProc field is DUIFEDEF. A sample DUIFEDEF is<br>
    shipped with the NetView program. DUIFEDEF can return the following:</p>

<ul class="c">
    <li>A list of zero or more possible resource names to GMFHS</li>
    <li>A feedback indicator that specifies whether the names are for a single non-SNA<br>resource or for multiple non-SNA resources</li>
    <li>The name of the RODM class containing these non-SNA resources</li>
    <li>The value for DisplayStatus</li>
</ul>

<p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b>Single Non-SNA Resource</b></Single><br>
    When the DUIFEDEF feedback indicator specifies that the names are for a single<br>
    non-SNA resource, then, for each name in this list, GMFHS tries to find an object<bR>
    in the class returned by DUIFEDEF, until either an object is found or the end of the<bR>
    list is reached.<br><br>
    For the first object found (and only this object), GMFHS:
<ul class="c">
    <li>Determines the DisplayStatus returned by DUIFEDEF or, if not present,<br>
        translates the status reported in the alert or resolution into a GMFHS<bR>
        DisplayStatus. Refer to the <i>IBM Tivoli NetView for z/OS Data Model Reference</i> for<bR>
        more information about the DisplayStatus field.</li>
    <li>Relates this status to the object in the class returned by DUIFEDEF.</li>
    <li>Builds an event report protocol data unit</li>
    <li>Logs this protocol data unit in the Dbserver database.</li>
</ul></p>
       <p style="padding-left: 6%;"><b style="font-size: 16px;">Multiple Non-SNA Resources</b><br>
       When the DUIFEDEF feedback indicator specifies that the names are for multiple<br>
non-SNA resources, GMFHS tries to find an object in the class returned by<bR>
DUIFEDEF for each name in the list. For each object found, GMFHS:</p>
<ul class="c">
    <li>Determines the DisplayStatus returned by DUIFEDEF or, if not present,<br>
        translates the status reported in the alert or resolution into a GMFHS<br>

    <li>Builds an event report protocol data unit.</li><hr><hr>
    <li>Logs this protocol data unit.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">All alerts and resolutions that report on resources in a non-SNA domain are<br>
    processed by the same AlertProc module. Be sure that the alerts and resolutions for<bR>
    any non-SNA domain where you have made modifications are always formatted so<br>
    that the AlertProc module for that domain produces the expected results.</p>

    DUIFEDEF provides the possible name of the non-SNA resource or resources<br>
    described in an alert or resolution, and the name of the class containing these<br>

    <p style="padding-left: 6%; font-size: 16px;"><b>Pointer to a reentrant work area</b></p>
     <p style="padding-left: 6%; ">  The AlertProc module is reentrant and uses this work area. The same work area is<br>
        shared among all AlertProc modules. An AlertProc module cannot assume that<bR>
        information the module stores in this work area is still intact at a later call of the<bR>
        module. The work area format is as follows:</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Part 3. Using RODM for Network Automation</b></p><hr><hr>

<hr style="height: 1px; color: black; background-color: black;">
<p style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Chapter 7. Writing Automation Code</b></p>

<p style="padding-left: 6%;">This chapter describes how you can write automation applications and methods to<br>
    interface with the data models that are supplied with the NetView program,<bR>
    including the GMFHS data model and the SNA topology manager data model. It<bR>
    also describes the rules and considerations involved in extending a data model that<bR>
    is supplied by the NetView program to meet your automation needs. When you<BR>
    design automation applications involving RODM, you can either design your own<BR>
    data model or use the data models that are supplied with the NetView program.</p>
<hr style="height: 1px; color: black; background-color: black;">
<p style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Advantages of Using the Supplied Data Models for Automation</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Though you can create your own data model instead of using the data models that<br>
    are supplied with the NetView program, consider the following advantages of<br>
    designing your automation routines around the data models that are supplied with<br>
    the NetView program:</p>

<ul class="d">
    <li>The supplied data models are designed to model networks, and if you use them,<br>
        you avoid the extra step of having to design and implement your own data<br>
        model, which can be time consuming and costly.</li>
    <li>The supplied data models provide many fields and objects that your automation<br>
        routines can use, such as the DisplayStatus field. After objects are defined in<bR>
        RODM using the supplied data models, these fields are maintained by NetView<br>code. Because you do not have to write the code to keep the fields up to date,<bR>
        you save resources.</li>
    <li>The NetView management console uses the information in the supplied data<br>
models to dynamically construct views of the network for workstation operators<bR>
who are monitoring the network. Operators make inferences as to the cause of<Br>
problems, based on the relationships of resources shown in the views and issue<br>
commands to initiate corrective action. If you are using the same data model for<br>
your automation that operators are using, you can correlate your automation<br>
with the people involved in operating and maintaining your network, as well as<br>
design automation routines for the network operators' tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">The GMFHS data model that is supplied with the NetView product as a RODM<br>load file might not meet all of your automation needs. For example, your<br>
    automation code might require a line speed field on link objects that is not<bR>
    currently provided by the GMFHS data model. You can modify the shipped source<br>
    data to meet your needs. Refer to IBM Tivoli NetView for z/OS Data Model Reference,<br> which describes all of the classes and fields in the data model, for information<br>
    about modifying the GMFHS data model.</p>

<hr style="height: 1px; color: black; background-color: black;">
<p style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Notifying Your Application about Changes in GMFHS Fields</b></p>

<p style="padding-left: 6%;">RODM can notify user applications when the value of a field in the data model<bR>
    changes. See “RODM Notification Process” on page 323 for a description of how to<bR>
    set up this notification. You can create notification subscriptions for fields on<bR>
    individual objects or for fields on classes. If you create a notification subscription<bR>
    for a field on a class, your user application is notified when that field changes on<bR>
    any object of the class.<br><bR>
        The NetView product supplies general purpose notification methods for use with<bR>
        RODM. You can use these notification methods to notify your user application of<br><bR><Br><br><br>
    
        changes to fields in the data model. Methods are supplied to notify when any<br>
        change to a field or to notify only when the value of a field exceeds or equals a<bR>
        specified value or values. You first define the notification method on the field of<bR>
        the object or class. Then your application subscribes to the notification queue of<bR>
        that notification method. See “Supplied Methods” on page 488 for a description of<bR>
        these methods. You can also write your own notification methods if the methods<BR>
        that are supplied with the NetView program do not meet your needs.<br><bR>
            One useful field for automation is the DisplayStatus field. This field indicates the<br>
            status of the resource. If you register your automation code on this field, your code<bR>
            is notified by RODM when the status of a resource changes. For example, if the<bR>
            status of a resource changes from satisfactory to unsatisfactory, your code can<br>
            check the relationship of this object and its status to other objects connected to it in<bR>
            order to determine whether this is a new problem or the symptom of a<Br>
            higher-level problem. The example program in “GMFHS Automation Example” on<bR>
            page 183 performs this task.<br><bR>
                Because RODM notifies your automation code when specified fields change, your<bR>
                automation code can focus on analyzing the information provided by the<bR>
                notification and taking appropriate action.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Accessing and Changing GMFHS-Defined Fields</b></p>

<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Your automation code can access all fields defined in the GMFHS Data Model to<br>
    determine the values of these fields. Your automation code can also change some<br>
    fields. The code must reflect the following rules:</p>
<ul class="d">
    <li>Do not change the values of class fields. Change values of object fields only. The<br>
        exceptions to this rule are the CodePage field of the<bR>
        Global_NLS_Parameters_Class and the UnknownThreshold field of the<bR>
        Global_Aggregation_Parameters_Class class</li>
    <li>Do not change the value of the fields of any object that is a descendant of one<bR>
        these classes:</li>
        – Agent_Parent_Class<bR>
       – Domain_Parent_Class<br>
       – View_Information_Reference_Class<br>
       – View_Information_Object_Class
    <li>Do not change the value of the DefaultAggregationPriorityCopy field on any<bR>
        objects.</li>
    <li>Do not change the value of the following fields of the<br>
        GMFHS_Aggregate_Objects_Class:</li>
        – SuspendedCount<br>
        – TotalRealResourceCount<br>
        – StatusGroupCounts<br>
        – PriorityXCPTCount,<br>
        – XCPTCount<br>
        – NOXCPTCount<br>
        – UnknownCount
    <li>For GMFHS data model fields on which change methods are installed, your<br>
        automation code must use the functions which trigger methods. For example,<bR>
        use the EKG_ChangeField or EKG_ChangeMultipleFields functions instead of<br>
        the EKG_ChangeSubfield function. If the change method is not triggered,<bR>
        operations such as aggregation calculations are not performed.</li>
    <li>GMFHS installs a notification method on all fields used by GMFHS to construct<br>
        graphical workstation views. Your automation code must use the functions that<br><bR><br>
            trigger methods when it changes fields in the GMFHS data model on which<br>
            notification methods are installed. For example, use the EKG_LinkTrigger<bR>
            function instead of the EKG_LinkNoTrigger function. If the notification method<bR>
            is not triggered, GMFHS cannot notify operators monitoring views of the<BR>
            change. See the specific field description to determine if GMFHS installs a<bR>
            notification method on the field.</li>
    <li>Some fields must be changed only by using the methods that are supplied with<br>
        the NetView program and that are designed to change those fields. The methods<bR>
        that can change these fields are described in “Using GMFHS Methods.”</li>
    <li>Do not add query methods to fields in the GMFHS data model.</li>
    <li>Do not add change methods to any fields that are created by IBM in the GMFHS<bR>
        data model. You can add change methods to fields you add to the data model.</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Using GMFHS Methods</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">This section briefly describes the GMFHS methods that your automation<br>
    applications and methods can access. See “GMFHS Methods” on page 496 for more<bR>
    information including the input and output parameters for each method.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 3%; font-size: 16px;"><b>DUIFCCAN: Clear All Notes</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">Use the DUIFCCAN method to clear all note fields without going through the<bR>
    topology console for each real and aggregate object. An operator ID of DUIFCCAN<br>is set to indicate that the note was cleared by this method, instead of an operator.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 3%; font-size: 16px;"><b>DUIFCATC: Aggregation Threshold Change</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">This is a change method installed on the aggregation threshold field of the<br>
    GMFHS_Aggregate_Objects_Class and is triggered if any of these field's values are<bR>
    changed. Your application does not directly run this method. However, when you<bR>
    design your application, consider that if more than one threshold value is being<bR>
    changed for an object, use the non-triggering (subfield) form of the change request<bR>
    for all but the last change. This eliminates unnecessary triggering of the<br>
    aggregation calculation method.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 3%; font-size: 16px;"><b>DUIFCLRT: Link Resource Type</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">This object-independent method links Display_Resource_Type_Class objects with<br>
    real and aggregate objects. This method is intended to be triggered using the<bR>
    RODM INVOKED_WITH load function primitive statement when you create your<br>
    network definition statements for GMFHS. Use this method for any application<br>
    that links or unlinks objects of the Display_Resource_Type_Class class with objects<bR>
    of the GMFHS_Managed_Real_Objects_Class class, or its child classes, or with<BR>
    objects of the GMFHS_Aggregate_Objects_Class class. The DUIFCLRT method<br>
    ensures that the DisplayStatus of aggregate resources is recalculated if necessary<bR>
    because of the link or unlink. See “DUIFCLRT: Link Resource Type Method” on<bR>
    page 497 for a description of the parameters for this method.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 3%; font-size: 16px;"><b>DUIFCUAP: Update Aggregation Path</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 6%;">This object-independent method is intended to be run using the INVOKED WITH<br>primitive of the RODM load function. Use this method for any application that is<br>
    changing the aggregation hierarchy. Use of this method ensures that the count<bR>
    fields and DisplayStatus of aggregate resources is recalculated as required by the<br><br><br>
    change. Note that running the DUIFFAWS method (aggregation warm start) after<bR>
    such a change accomplishes the same thing, but it is more expensive and is<bR>
    intended to be an initialization method.</p>
<p class="e"><b>DUIFCUUS: Update User Status</b></p>
<p class="f">This named method can be used by an application to update the UserStatus field<bR>
    of objects within the GMFHS_Displayable_Objects_Parent_Class class. While the<bR>
    UserStatus field value can be changed directly, use the DUIFCUUS method to<bR>
    prevent changes that are irrelevant or incorrect, such as suspending aggregation for<br>
    a shadow object.</p>

<p class="e"><b>DUIFECDS: Change Display Status</b></p>
<p class="f">This named method can be used by an application to update the DisplayStatus<br>
    field of objects within GMFHS_Managed_Real_Objects_Class class. This method<bR>
    offers the advantage of checking the SourceStatusUpdateTime field value in the<bR>
    target object against one provided by the invoker to ensure that updates are not<bR>
    applied if the status provided is older than that in the object.</p>
<p class="e"><b>DUIFFAWS: Aggregation Warm Start</b></p>
<p class="f">Run this object-independent method by any application that needs to ensure that<br>
    the count and DisplayStatus values of aggregate resources are correct before<bR>
    proceeding. It requires no short-lived parameters.<br><br>
    You might need to run this method if you receive the DUI4020A message with<br>
    method name DUIFCUAC. This indicates a problem with status being propagated<bR>
    through the aggregation hierarchy. You trigger the DUIFFAWS method when you<bR>
    use the GMFHS CONFIG NETWORK command to reinitialize GMFHS.<br><bR>
        You can also trigger this method with the following RODM load function primitive<br>
        statement: OP DUIFFAWS INVOKED_WITH.</p>
<p class="e"><b>DUIFFIRS: Set Initial Resource Status</b></p>
<p class="f">This object-independent method is used by GMFHS to set the DisplayStatus of all<bR>
    of the real resource objects linked to the ContainsResource field of a<bR>
    Non_SNA_Domain_Class object to the InitialResourceStatus value of that domain<bR>
    object. You might find this method useful for an application that is initializing and<bR>
    maintaining its own real resource DisplayStatus (in place of GMFHS).</p>

<p class="e"><b>DUIFFRAS: Recalculate Aggregate Status</b></p>
<p class="f">This object-independent method can be run by any application to cause the<bR>
    DisplayStatus value of all the GMFHS_Aggregate_Objects_Class objects to be<bR>
    recalculated. This method is useful if it is believed that the count fields of the<bR>
    aggregate objects are correct but that the DisplayStatus might be incorrect. The<br>
    DUIFFRAS method requires no input parameters. If fields other than DisplayStatus<br>
    might be corrupted, use the DUIFFAWS method instead.<br><bR>
        This method can also be triggered with the following RODM load function<br>
        primitive statement: OP DUIFFRAS INVOKED_WITH.</p>
<p class="e"><b>DUIFFSUS: Set Unknown Status</b></p>
<p class="f">This object-independent method is used by GMFHS to set the DisplayStatus of all<br>
    of the real resource objects linked to the ContainsResource field of a<bR>
    Non_SNA_Domain_Class object to the unknown value. You might find this<br><bR><br>
        method useful for an application that is initializing and maintaining its own real<bR>
        resource DisplayStatus (in place of GMFHS).</p>
<p class="e"><b>DUIFRFDS: Refresh DisplayStatus Change Method DUIFCRDC</b></p>
<p class="f">This object-independent method can be called by any application to change the<br>
    DisplayStatus field to the current DisplayStatus value for every real and aggregate<br>
    resource defined in RODM. This method is useful when the DisplayStatus<br>
    mapping table (DUIFSMT) has been changed. Instead of waiting on a status<br>
    change from the network to trigger an exception view update, method DUIFRFDS<bR>
    can be run to cause the status change which recalculates the exception state for the<bR>
    objects. The appropriate exception views are then updated. For more information,<BR>
    see “Customizing the DisplayStatus Mapping Table for Exception Views” on page<br>
    102.</p>
<p class="e"><b>DUIFVCFT: Change Exception State</b></p>
<p class="f">This object-independent method can be called by a user method to change the<br>
    exception state of an object. The user method is specified by the USRXMETH<bR>
    keyword in DisplayStatus mapping table DUIFSMT. Sample user methods<Br>
    DUIFCUXM and DUIFCUX2 run method DUIFVCFT to set either value XCPT or<bR>
    NOXCPT in the ResourceTraits field the same way a real DisplayStatus change is<bR>
    processed. DUIFVCFT then triggers a method to determine whether the change in<br>
    exception state will cause the object to be added to or deleted from any open<bR>
    exception views.</p>
<p class="e"><b>DUIFVINS: Install View Notification Granularity Method</b></p>
<p class="f">This object-independent method is used by GMFHS to install the view notification<br>
    granularity method, DUIFVNOT, on a field. See “DUIFVINS: Install View<br>
    Granularity Method (DUIFVNOT)” on page 507 for a description of this method.</p>
<p class="e"><b>GMFHS Methods That Cannot Be Used</b></p>
<p class="f">In addition to the GMFHS methods described in this section, GMFHS uses other<br>
    methods that cannot be used by your programs. See “GMFHS Methods” on page<br>
    496 for a list of GMFHS methods that you cannot use.</p>

 <hr style="height: 1px; color: black; background-color: black;">
<p style="font-size: 16px;"><b>GMFHS Automation Example</b></p>
<p class="f">This section presents an automation example, which consists of an application and<bR>
    a method. It is intended to describe how you might set up your own application<br>
    for automating a complex task. Though this example uses a DisplayStatus field<br>
    that is defined on the GMFHS_Managed_Real_Objects_Class class, this example<br>
    applies to any object class that has a DisplayStatus field defined.<br><br>
    In this example, the automation application runs under the NetView product, but<br>
    an application can also run in its own address space. This example connects to<br>
    RODM and requests to be notified when the DisplayStatus field of a<br>
    GMFHS_Managed_Real_Objects_Class object changes in value. This change occurs<bR>
    as a result of an alert coming in for the object that is analyzed by GMFHS.<br><br>
    In this example, the application is registered to be notified if the status changes for<br>
    either of the two minicomputers contained in the sample network described in<bR>
    Chapter 2, “Defining Your Network to GMFHS,” on page 15 and illustrated in<Br>
    Figure 3 on page 18. When the application determines that the status of one of<bR>
    these resources has changed to unsatisfactory, it runs an object-independent<Br>
    method running under RODM. This method queries the ParentAccess field of the<bR><bR><br>
        resource whose status has changed and its parents, until it either encounters a<bR>
        resource with Unsatisfactory status or encounters a resource with no ParentAccess<bR>
        link. The method then informs the running application whether or not it has found<br>
        an ancestor resource that is in an unsatisfactory state.<br><bR><bR>
            If the method finds an ancestor resource in an unsatisfactory state, the running<br>
            application assumes that the alert is a symptom of a higher-level problem and does<bR>
            nothing further. If the method does not find an ancestor resource in an<br>
            unsatisfactory state, the running application assumes that the alert represents a<bR>
            new problem. In this case, the application might open a problem report for the<bR>
            new problem using the NetView Bridge or issue appropriate commands to bypass<Br>
            the problem. The action taken depends upon the installation, and so is not shown<br>
            in the code.<br><br>
            The GMFHS automation example is intended to illustrate a possible use of RODM<br>automation and to demonstrate how to write code that uses the RODM interface;<br>
            do not view this as a solution to a particular automation problem. The program<br>
            does not check for loops in the parent-child path. The logic of the program is<bR>
            based on the assumption that if a higher-level resource is down, the alert for a<bR>
            lower-level resource is a symptom of that problem, or at least represents a problem<br>that cannot be attended to until the higher-level problem is solved. This<br>
            assumption is not always valid; its validity depends upon the installation and<br>
            network resources involved. The example illustrates an automation of the work of<bR>
            GMFHS operators and their inferences and actions as they monitor configuration<br>
            and status information on workstations.</p>
<p class="e"><b>Sample Automation Application and Method</b></p>
<p class="f">The CNMSNIFF sample application program accepts a RODM name, a RODM user<br>
    name, and a RODM password from the NetView command line. The application<bR>
    then uses the three parameters to perform the following functions:<br>
    1. Sends a connect request to the specified RODM.<br>
    2. Subscribes to the DisplayStatus fields of objects that represent resources in the<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SYSPLEX network.<br>
    3. Issues EKGWAIT and waits for the DisplayStatus fields of objects that represent<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resources in the SYSPLEX network to change.<br>
    4. Triggers the EKGSNIFF sample object-independent method when one or more<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DisplayStatus fields change.<bR>
        5. The sample code does no processing at this step. If you were creating a<bR>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;working automation application, you might create appropriate code for your<bR>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;system to correct the problem or to log a problem record based on the return<Br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and reason code returned by the EKGSNIFF method after the EKGSNIFF<Br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;method finishes processing.<br>
        6. Issues EKGWAIT and waits until either a problem occurs or RODM ends.<br>
        The CNMSNIFF application is written in C and runs in the NetView address space.<br>
The source code for this example application is shipped as a NetView sample. The<br>
sample name is CNMS4402 (alias CNMSNIFF) in data set CNMSAMP.<br><br>
The EKGSNIFF sample object-independent method is triggered by the CNMSNIFF<bR>
sample automation application program. The EKGSNIFF method accepts an<bR>
ObjectID of the target object as a parameter. When triggered, the EKGSNIFF<br>
method queries the DisplayStatus fields of the target object and the object's parent.<bR>
The method then returns a return and reason code, based on the values of the<br><br><br>

DisplayStatus fields of the target object and its parent, to the CNMSNIFF<bR>
automation program that is in the transaction information block.<br><br>

The source code for the EKGSNIFF method is shipped as a NetView sample. The<br>
sample name is CNMS4403 (alias EKGSNIFF) in data set CNMSAMP.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Chapter 8. Using the RODM Automation Platform</b></p>

<p class="f">This chapter is an overview of the RODM automation platform. The RODM<br>
    <i>automation platform</i> is a set of NetView services that make automation using RODMeasier.<br><br>
    Additional information about the RODM automation platform is contained in the<br>
    <i>IBM Tivoli NetView for z/OS Automation Guide</i>. This book also contains an extensive<bR>
    RODM automation scenario which shows how the automation platform can be<br>
    used.</p>
<hr style="height: 1px; color: black; background-color: black;">
<p style="font-size: 16px;"><b>RODM Automation Platform Services</b></p>
<p class="f">The following services make up the RODM automation platform:</p>
<ul class="c">
    <li>DSIQTSK task</li>
    <li>ORCONV command</li>
    <li>EKGSPPI method</li>
    <li>CNMQAPI service routine</li>
    <li>DSINOR service routine</li>
    <li>ORCNTL command</li>
</ul>
<p class="f">The DSIQTSK task is dedicated to communicating with the RODM address space.<bR>
    It receives command requests from EKGSPPI and dispatches the commands to an<bR>
    autotask. Each RODM that you want to manage from the NetView address space<Br>
    must be defined to DSIQTSK.<br><bR>
        The ORCONV command enables the NetView automation table, command lists,<br>
        and applications to issue requests to RODM that change values of fields and<bR>
        trigger methods. The ORCONV command requires that the DSIQTSK task is<bR>
        running in the NetView from which the commands are issued, and that RODM is<bR>
        defined to the DSIQTSK task.<bR><br>
            The EKGSPPI method that is supplied with the NetView program sends<bR>
            commands from RODM to the DSIQTSK task in the NetView product using the<bR>
            program-to-program interface. See “EKGSPPI: Send a command to the NetView<BR>
            Program” on page 493 for a description of the EKGSPPI method.<br><bR>
                The CNMQAPI service routine is an enhanced API that enables applications in the<br>
                NetView address space to issue RODM functions with less programming effort.<bR>
                CNMQAPI can be used with the PL/I and C high-level languages. CNMQAPI<br>
                enables an application to issue requests while RODM is processing a checkpoint<bR>
                request. CNMQAPI queues the requests and sends them to RODM when the<BR>
                checkpoint process is complete. Refer to the <i>IBM Tivoli NetView for z/OS<Br>
                Programming: PL/I and</i> C for the syntax of CNMQAPI.<br><bR>
                    The DSINOR assembler-language macro provides an API like CNMQAPI for<br>
                    assembler applications running in the NetView address space. Refer to the <i>IBM<br>Tivoli NetView for z/OS Programming: Assembler</i> for the syntax of DSINOR.<br><br>
                    The ORCNTL command manages the administrative details about the RODMs<br>
                    defined to the DSIQTSK task. See the ORCNTL command in NetView online help<br>
                    for more information.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Chapter 9. Understanding RODM Concepts</b></p>
<p class="f">This chapter describes the structure of the RODM data cache, methods, and<br>
    applications. This chapter will help you understand RODM concepts so that you<bR>
    can create your own data models and associated methods and applications.<br><br>
    This chapter explains the RODM abstract data types. These data types, such as<br>
    Integer and MethodSpec define the format of data stored in RODM.</p>
<hr style="height: 1px; color: black; background-color: black;">
<p style="font-size: 16px;"><b>RODM Classes</b></p>
<p class="f">The ability to group objects and the ability to group or arrange groups of objects is<br>
    useful in network management. RODM implements this concept of grouping<bR>
    through the use of <i>classes.</i> Classes define the data structure of the data cache.<br><br>
    A class represents a grouping and defines fields for all classes and objects below<br>
    that class. If you view the RODM data cache as a tree structure, classes represent<br>
    the branches of the tree with the UniversalClass as the top-most class. Figure 37 on<br>
    page 192 shows an example of the tree structure.<br><bR>
        RODM classes:</p>
<ul class="c">
    <li>Can have:</li>

    – Class children only<br>
    – Object children only<br>
    – Both class and object children

<p class="e"><b>Class Names</b></p>
<p class="f">Each RODM class has a character string in its MyName field called the <i>class name.</i><br> RODM system-defined class names are reserved by RODM and cannot be deleted.<br>
    All system-defined names, except for UniversalClass, begin with EKG_.<br><Br>
        The CHARACTER_VALIDATION keyword in EKGCUST specifies what degree of<br>
        validity checking RODM performs for characters used in object names (see “Object<bR>
        Names” on page 205), field names (see “Field Names” on page 206), and class<Br>

            When CHARACTER_VALIDATION(YES), which is the default, is coded in<br>
            EKGCUST, valid class names have the following characteristics:</p>
<ul class="c">
    <li>The name consists of 1 to 64 characters that conform to the ShortName data type<br>
        with the PL/I syntax of CHAR(64) VARYING.</li>
    <li>The first character of the string must be alphabetic or numeric. The others, if<bR>
        any, can be alphabetic, numeric, the break character (_), the commercial “at” sign<bR>
        (@), the number sign (#), or the period (.).</li><br><br><bR>
    <li>The EKG_ prefix is reserved for RODM created classes. Do not use this prefix in<bR>
        the names of classes that you create.</li>
    <li>Both uppercase and lowercase alphabetic characters are permitted, and names<br>
        are case-sensitive.</li>
    <li>Each class name in the RODM data cache is unique. RODM supports a<br>

<ul class="c">
    <li>The name consists of 1 to 64 characters that conform to the ShortName data type<br>
        with the PL/I syntax of CHAR(64) VARYING.</li>
    <li>The first character cannot be the number sign (#) because it is reserved for<br>
        MultiSystem Manager.</li>
    <li>Blank characters are not valid</li>
    <li>Null characters are not valid.</li>
    <li>The EKG_ prefix is reserved for RODM created classes. Do not use this prefix in<br>

<p class="e"><b>System-Defined Classes</b></p>
<p class="f">When RODM is cold started, RODM initialization occurs and the class definitions<br>
    are created. This data model provides the starting point for all RODM classes and<br>
    objects. These <i>system-defined classes</i> enable users to access information about their<Br>
    application and about RODM itself. Figure 37 shows the RODM system-defined<Br>
    classes and their hierarchy.<br><br><br><br><br>
    <i>Figure 37. RODM System-Defined Classes</i><br><br>
    RODM has the following system-defined classes:</p>
<p class="f"><b>UniversalClass</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 8%;">The root of the inheritance tree structure of the RODM data cache</p>
<p class="f"><b>EKG_SystemDataParent</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 8%;">The system data parent class, the parent of all RODM predefined system<br>
    classes</p><hr><hr>
<p class="f"><b>EKG_System</b></p>

<p class="f"><b>EKG_Method</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 8%;">The method object class, the fields and methods that RODM creates when<br>
    you install a method</p>
<p class="f">The following six sections describe the six RODM system-defined classes.<br>
    Information, which is common to all six classes, includes the following:</p>
<ul class="c">
    <li>The fields that are created by RODM and can be accessed by application<bR>
        programs and methods.</li>
    <li>The subfields that are created by RODM on system-defined fields. User<bR>
        applications cannot add subfields to fields of system-defined classes. You can<br>
        add notification subscriptions to the specified fields using the<BR>
        EKG_AddNotifySubscription function.</li>
    <li>The specification of the notify subfield identifies the fields to which an<br>
        application can subscribe for notification. RODM notifies each application which<br>
        has subscribed to a field when the value of the field changes.</li>
    <li>Applications can change write-access fields only.</li>
    <li>Applications can change values in the fields of objects only.</li>
</ul>
<p class="f"><b>UniversalClass</b><br>
    UniversalClass is the RODM universal class, the root of the hierarchy of RODM<br>classes. All classes and objects are descendents of the universal class. Each class<bR>

    fields are not inherited, just the field definitions.<br><br>
    The UniversalClass has no parent<br><bR>

    notification queues or to purge nothing. Valid values are as follows:<br><br>
    <table>
        <th>Value</th><th>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meaning</th>
        <tr><td>1</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purge notification queues and subscriptions</td></tr>
        <tr><td>2</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purge notification queue elements only</td></tr><tr>
        <tr><td>3</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not purge notification queues or &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;subscriptions</td></tr>
    </table><br>
    If one of your applications disconnects with a setting that preserves queues,<bR>
subscriptions, or both, and then some event changes this field while your<br><Br><br><br><BR>

    application is disconnected, the new setting of the field has immediate effect.<bR>
But if the new setting is to preserve the queues, the subscriptions, or both, the<bR>
new setting cannot take effect until your application reconnects and establishes<bR>
new queues and subscriptions.<bR><br>
    Purging queues without purging subscriptions causes RODM to purge only the<br>
    data associated with notification queues. RODM retains the<bR>
    EKG_NotificationQueue object. If your application or RODM purges all of the<bR>
    subscriptions for a specified queue, RODM also purges the<bR>
    EKG_NotificationQueue object for that queue.</p>
<p class="f" ><b>EKG_LastAsyncError</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 8%;">Last asynchronous error. Users can subscribe to this field for notification of any<br>
    asynchronous error associated with transactions that this user ID has initiated.<bR>
    When RODM logs an error, it writes a copy of the error record into this field,<bR>
    even if it does not write the error record to the RODM log. RODM then<Br>
    notifies the users subscribed to this field.<br><br>
    RODM also defines an EKG_LastAsyncError field on the EKG_System class.<br>
    EKG_LastAsyncError on EKG_System contains the last error for any user of<bR>
    RODM. EKG_LastAsyncError on EKG_User contains the last error for the user<bR>
    of RODM defined by a particular object under EKG_User.</p>
<p class="f" ><b>EKG_Uses_Q</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 8%;">A list of links to notification queue objects. This list contains a link for each<br>
    queue specified by a notification subscription for this user. RODM creates the<br>
    links in this list in response to subscription requests. The link is between the<bR>
    EKG_Uses_Q field of the User object and the EKG_UsedBy field of the<bR>
    EKG_NotificationQueue object.</p>
<p class="f" ><b>EKG_RBOverflowAction</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 8%;">Response block overflow action control. Valid values are as follows:<bR><br>
    <table>
        <th>Value</th><th>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meaning</th>
        <tr><td>1</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save</td></tr>
        <tr><td>2</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discard</td></tr><tr>
    </table><br><br>
    If your application sets the value of this field to save, RODM automatically<bR>
collects response block overflow data in a buffer. Your application then must<bR>
get the overflow data from the buffer before it can query other data. If your<br>
application sets the value of this field to discard, RODM discards any overflow<br>data. If the value of this field is changed from save to discard, RODM<br>
immediately discards all collected overflow data associated with the<br>
User_appl_ID. The default value for this field is save.<bR><br>
    If a single user is running concurrent transactions through multitasking and<bR>
one thread causes a response block overflow and a different thread changes<bR>
this field to discard, the transaction causing the overflow might receive a<br>
return code indicating the overflow. However, the overflow data is discarded.</p>
<p class="f" ><b>EKG_LogLevel</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 8%;">Logging level control for user API functions. After the processing of a<br>
    transaction is complete, this parameter determines whether or not to write a<bR>
    log record to record this transaction. The basis of the log control is the<br>
    transaction return code. If the transaction return code is greater than or equal<bR>
    to EKG_LogLevel, RODM writes a log record. Your application can override<bR>
    the default value for the class by specifying a new value in this field. If your<bR>
    application specifies a value of 0, RODM writes for that application a log<br>
    record of all transactions across the user API.,br><bR><br><br><Br>
        RODM reads the customization file to determine the default value to assign to<br>
        the class level field. If the customization file contains a LOG_LEVEL parameter,<bR> the value of that parameter determines the class default value. If the<br>
        customization file does not contain a value for LOG_LEVEL, the default value<br>
        of 8 is used.</p>
<p class="f" ><b>EKG_MLogLevel</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 8%;">Specifies the log level for tracing method API function calls. RODM generates<br>
    a log record when the return code from a method API function call is greater<bR>
    than or equal to the value of EKG_MLogLevel.<br><br>
    This field is filled in from the MLOG_LEVEL operand in the RODM<br>
    customization file at warm start and at cold start.</p>
<p class="f" ><b>EKG_MTraceType</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 8%;">Specifies whether RODM traces method entry and exit and specifies the type<br>
    of methods RODM traces. This field is filled in from the MTRACE_TYPE<bR>
    operand in the RODM customization file at warm start and at cold start.<br><bR>
        The first three bytes of EKG_MTraceType are always X'000000'. The right-hand<bR>
        byte is used as seven flag bits:<br><br>
        <table width="40%">
            <th>Bit</th><th>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meaning if bit is set</th>
            <tr><td>1... ....</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trace object deletion methods</td></tr>
            <tr><td>.1.. ....</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trace object independent &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;methods</td></tr><tr>
            <tr><td>..1. ....</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trace named methods</td></tr>
           <tr><td>...1 ....</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trace notify methods</td></tr><tr>
        <tr><td>.... 1...</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trace change methods</td></tr>
        <tr><td>.... .1..</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trace query methods</td></tr><tr>
        <tr><td>.... ..1.</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trace method exit and storage</td></tr>
        <tr><td>.... ...1</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trace method entry and storage</td></tr><tr>
        </table><br><br>
        You can set any combination of these 7 bits. If the trace method entry and trace<bR>
method exit bits are both zero, method tracing is inactive. If all bits are zero,<bR>
all tracing is inactive.<bR><br>
    RODM generates a log record when method entry or method exit tracing is<bR>
specified.<br><BR>
    The EKG_MTraceFlag field for each method object, in addition to the<Br>
corresponding method-type bit in EKG_MTraceType, specifies whether a<bR>
method is enabled for tracing. If either the corresponding method-type bit in<bR>
EKG_MTraceType is set or the EKG_MTraceFlag field in the associated method<bR>
object is one, the method is traced.</p>

<p class="f" style="font-size: 16px;" ><b>EKG_NotificationQueue Class</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 8%;">EKG_NotificationQueue is the class of notification queues. Notification queues are<br>
    used for the RODM notification process. See “RODM Notification Process” on page<bR>
    323 for more information about notification.<br><br>
    The parent is EKG_SystemDataParent.<br><bR>
        An application or method creates a notification queue by creating an object of the<bR>
        EKG_NotificationQueue class. The EKG_CreateObject function directs RODM to<bR>
        create the notification queue object and assign a user specified event control block<bR>
        (ECB) to the queue object. Once the queue is created, notification methods can</p>
